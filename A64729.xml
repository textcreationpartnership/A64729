            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>COuld I have manag'd the Evidence in Proof, of the Murder of this Honourable Lord, with that ſtrength and efficacy they are capable of, nothing would more plainly have appeared to the impartial Reader, than this (to me) great Truth, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Right Honourable <hi>Arthur,</hi> late Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> was moſt Treacherouſly and Barbarouſly Murdered. But ſuch as it is, I do, with all Humility, caſt it at your Lordſhips Feet, to whoſe great Judgments I ſhall, with intire reſignation, ſubmit.</p>
            <p>My Lords, Having long known, and been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much converſant with Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> I have had often Opportunities of diſcourſing almoſt every Witneſs in this Caſe examined; and ſuch as I my ſelf have not ſpoke with, I have from him been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what ſuch have declared: And though the Account I have here given of what theſe have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, which have been examined before your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, be more large and particular than their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, (becauſe I have had repeated Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of hearing their Relations) yet, if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſay true, nothing in theſe Papers is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to or inconſistent with what they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed before your Lordſhips.</p>
            <p>My Lords, In the Account at large I have firſt ſtated, the Caſe, as to the pretended Self-Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as it was and is endeavoured to be proved by thoſe immediately attending on my Lord; and then I have divided the Proofs for this Murder into three General Heads, as they have relation to Time: Whether,
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Before the Day of my Lord's Death.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And after every Proof, I have raiſed all ſuch Objections I could in Converſation ever meet with, or my ſelf could object, which carried the leaſt colour of Argument againſt ſuch Evidence; and the Solutions, with all humility, are ſubmitted to your Lordſhips Cenſures.</p>
            <p>In the Abſtract, I have obſerved this Order: Firſt, I have ſtated the Caſe, as repreſented and ſworn by thoſe that would prove the Self-Murder; and then detected the Falſity of every Part of thoſe Relations. After which I have briefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the other Proofs in the ſame Order of Time as the Diſcourſe at large.</p>
            <p>My Lords, Several things here mentioned have not as yet been before your Lordſhips, ſome of theſe Relations having not been known to Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> before your Lordſhips Committee was diſſolved: But theſe after-Teſtimonies, and ſome other things not here taken notice of, will be brought before your Lordſhips, as ſoon as your Lordſhips ſhall think fit to move that thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and Examinations now ſealed up, may be taken out of the Houſe by your Lordſhips, and to thoſe added ſuch other Teſtimonies as have been taken before ſeveral Juſtices, (ſince the Report made) or are ready to be taken; and then, that, as well ſuch as are now ſealed up, as thoſe others which have been, or ſhall be depoſed, may be reported by your Lordſhips, in ſuch Method,
<pb facs="tcp:41825:3"/>as to your Lordſhips great Wiſdom ſhall ſeem moſt meet. After which I doubt not but all your Lordſhips, and the whole World, will be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of that Truth which the Intereſt of ſo many have induſtriouſly endeavoured to ſtifle: <hi>But there is no Power of Earth, and Hell, when conjoined, can make that Thing never to have been, which was.</hi> And therefore if my Lord was treacherouſly and barbarouſly murdered, no Intereſt or Strength what-ever can make him a Self-murderer. Truth may be deſtroyed in its Credit, but never in its Being; and the Meaſures that have been taken to diſcredit the Proof of this Murder, have been ſufficiently detected as falſe, which hath not a little increaſed the Credibility of that which thoſe Counter-Evidences would have rendered incredible and falſe.</p>
            <p>My Lords, No two Truths in Nature are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſistent; for then a Thing would be, and not be, at the ſame time: wherefore when Men would ſubvert the belief of a Truth, they do raiſe ſome Falſhood which ſtands in oppoſition to ſuch Truth; but if once this Falſhood appears in its true Colour, then doth it give ſtronger credit to that Truth, which before it was deſigned to prejudice.</p>
            <p>My Lords, every Man's Defence virtually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes. If my Defence be falſe, my Charge is true. This Concluſion the Law makes in all Civil Actions, and it's according to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Thing: For all Men preſume that every Man accuſed, will make uſe of the beſt Arguments (eſpecially in Matters of Fact) he can for his Defence; and if thoſe appear falſe, he falls under a Self-Condemnation. My Lords, tho this Diſcourſe is printed, it's not publiſhed, nor above <hi>200</hi> printed, as is ready to be proved; neither will one of theſe be communicated to any, if your Lordſhips ſhall ſo order it; for all are kept till Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> receives your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Commands as to their diſpoſal. My Lords, I could wiſh I had not been ſo large in this Diſcourſe, ſeeing your Lordſhips whole time is ſo ingroſſed by the Publick, that I fear the State can ſcarce allow your Lordſhips any hours of peruſal. My Lords, tho I can't but humbly beſeech your Lordſhips Pardon for this Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet I could not, without being guilty of the greateſt Injuſtice, any otherwiſe dedicate this Diſcourſe, ſeeing what hath been already diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, is chiefly owing to your Lordſhips un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied Diligence in thoſe many Committees, in which your Lordſhips have ſo often ſat in ſearch of a Truth, which the Impenitency of ſome, and the induſtrious Intereſt of others have ſtrongly oppoſed. But maugre all Oponents, the matter is (as I do humbly conceive) ſo far detected, as Circumſtantial Evidence is (almoſt) capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of; and thoſe that will not be convinced of the Truth of a Murder, unleſs poſitively atteſted, demand ſuch Proof for their Conviction as no Law requires. Now that the God of Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs and Truth, may direct and proſper your Lordſhips in this, and all other <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, is the Humble Prayer of,</p>

               <p>SIR, I rejoyce I have thus fortunately met you here; for ever ſince I came to Town, I have longed to ſee you, becauſe I have been deſired by many of our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to give them what Information I can, how the Caſe of the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> now ſtands; whether there have been any Informations, or Examinations herein, taken before the Honourable Houſe of Lords (for we have heard their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, upon their firſt ſitting, took the matter into Examination) and what you have heard to be the Subſtance of thoſe Depoſitions and Examinations, whether ſufficient to prove that unfortunate Lord treacherouſly murdered, as he was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed to be.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A Templer.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, you could never have met me more opportunely for your Satisfaction in this, ſeeing I have now about me the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all thoſe Depoſitions and Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations that have been taken before the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Committee of Lords appointed by the Houſe for this purpoſe, and ſome time ſince reported to the Houſe; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Copies of many Informations herein taken before ſome Juſtices of the Peace; beſides all which, I have Copies of ſuch Depoſitions as have been ſworn to deſtroy the Credit of what hath been materially depoſed to prove that unfortunate Lord villanouſly murdered; and further, I have ſeveral Informations taken to ſtrengthen my Lord's Evidence, in Anſwer to thoſe Depoſitions, on the behalf of the Priſoner. Of all which I have had an Opportunity to take Copies, by being daily, converſant with that Gentleman, whoſe Misfortunes have made him of all Men the beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this Caſe. Sir, there is hardly a Witneſs herein ſworn but what I have diſcourſed; neither do I believe there is any Objection can be raiſed againſt the Proof of my Lord's being murdered, but what I can ſufficiently Anſwer. All which your Authority ſhall command from me, who rejoyce in this Occaſion of ſerving you. But I queſtion whether it may not be thought a divulging of what a Secret Committee hath had under Examination, and ought ſtill to be kept private.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>You can't but know that this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Committee is diſſolved, by the Reports being made to the Houſe, where the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions having been read, it can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be thought a Secret: And it being for the Intereſt of the Kingdom it ſhould be publiſhed (if there be any Evidence to prove this Murder) I can't imagine how your communicating this matter can in the leaſt prejudice this Cauſe, the juſt Succeſs whereof no Man living can deſire with greater impatience than my ſelf, who ſhall (its probable) by your now-Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, be able to ſtop the Mouths of thoſe Gainſayers, which not ſo much out of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, as Miſinformation, ſeem totally to disbelieve this matter; of which number Mr. <hi>O.</hi> of <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> (our Friend, and old Acquaintance) is one; he did appoint to be here preciſely at this time.

               <p>Sir, the Buſineſs we are upon you are free to hear, and I do very much rejoyce in this Opportunity of making you a Convert.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>In what (pray Sir?) for if I am in any Error, I hope I am not thereto ſo wedded, but upon good Cauſe ſhewn, ſhall readily ſue a Divorce, and thank you hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for my Conviction.</p>

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>This Gentleman is about giving ſuch Reaſons as will convince (not me, for I do already believe it, but) you, That the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was treacherouſly and villanouſly murdered.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Piſh! there is not the leaſt ground for ſuch a Belief, neither hath there been any colour of Evidence for it produced to the Lords. Moreover, all my Lord's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are ſo firmly poſſeſſed with the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed cut his own Throat, that neither of them hath thought fit in the leaſt to move in this matter, but all of them wiſh that this Cauſe had never been revived, becauſe it renews the Remembrance of that ſad and deplorable Accident which hath been ſo great a Misfortune to that Honourable Family.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I perceive you have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed in every part of your Information, for your Author ſcarce told you one Word of Truth. As for the Families not appearing in (but being very averſe to) this Proſecution, I do aſſure you (Sir) this is far from being true; for no Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man could ſhew more Honour, and greater Zeal in a Cauſe, than the Right Honourable Sir <hi>Henry Capel</hi> (the late Earl's only Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) hath done in this, and cauſed ſome to be taken up for endeavouring to abuſe the World with the Belief, that he had not engaged in this matter. The now Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was not returned from his Travels when this Proſecution was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; but as ſoon as he came, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip approved of what was done, and hath been at the Charge of this Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, in which you may believe there hath been no ſmall Expence, there ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been in this Cauſe ſuch a number of Witneſſes examined, and ſo many ſeveral Committees. And whereas you ſay there was not the leaſt Colour of Evidence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Lords: Did you ever hear what Perſons were ſworn before their Lordſhips, and after examined by this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Committee.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Not in every particular, but in part I have, and in general have been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Witneſſes produced by that Gentleman, who pretended to prove it, were looked upon as altogether inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for that end; and therefore the Houſe of Lords, upon reading the Informations in this Caſe taken by the Committee, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately rejected them as frivolous, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ordering, that all ſuch as had been taken up, as ſuſpected concerned in this pretended Murder, ſhould be diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>I perceive in this alſo you have been miſinformed, as to both particulars; for the Houſe of Lords upon reading what was taken by the Honourable Lords of this Committee, neither rejected the Evidence as inſufficient, nor ordered the diſcharge of ſuch as in this caſe were taken up, but the Depoſitions being read before the Houſe, when three of the four Honourable Lords of this Committee were out of Town <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Earl of <hi>Devon,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> (the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> being the firſt in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee) the Houſe ordered all thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and Examinations to be ſealed up, and kept by the Clerk of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till theſe three Lords returned, and in the mean time the farther Debate hereupon to be ſuſpended: To prove all which, pray Sir, read this Order made <hi>Die Jovis</hi> 23<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Maii,</hi> 1689.</p>

               <p>I thank you, Sir, for your Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion herein, and its very probable thoſe who gave me ſuch falſe Information as to the Lords Proceedings in this Matter, may have likewiſe forged what Arguments they thought might ſway with me to believe my Lords ſelf Murder; what thoſe are I ſhall give you an Account. But I firſt deſire to hear what Evidence in particular hath been produced to prove my Lords being murdered by others.</p>

               <p>The 21ſt of <hi>January</hi> laſt, (being the day before the Convention ſat) ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were taken up, as ſuſpected to be privy to my Lords Murder; amongſt whom was Major <hi>Hawley,</hi> (Major of the <hi>Tower</hi>) in whoſe Houſe my Lord was murdered, and <hi>Thomas Ruſſell,</hi> one of the two War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that ſtood upon my Lord at the time of his death: theſe two belonging to the Tower, and conſequently under the Command of the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Lucas</hi> Governour of the Tower, were not taken up by any Conſtable; but his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip having ſeen the Warrant out againſt them, ordered both to be ſecured. The next day, being the 22d, ſeveral Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations were taken before <hi>John Robins</hi> Eſquire, one of the <hi>Middleſex</hi> Juſtices, who carried Coppies of theſe Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to my Lord <hi>Lucas.</hi> His Lordſhip the 24th moved the Houſe of Lords for their Lordſhips Order, as to the keeping, diſcharging, or removing <hi>Hawley</hi> and <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> as before ſecured by his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Command; and then produced to the Houſe thoſe Informations brought his Lordſhip, as before by Mr. <hi>Robins;</hi> upon reading which, after ſome Debate, the Houſe of Lords ordered Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> to be called in before their Lordſhips, and after
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41825:7"/>his Examination, their Lordſhips conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a Committee of Lords, of which the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> (now Lord Steward of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Houſhold) was Chairman. After this Committee had ſeveral times met, there was a ſecret Committee ordered to examine into the Matter; which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee conſiſted of theſe Four Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lords, <hi>(viz)</hi> the Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Devon,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> (then Lord <hi>Mordant</hi>) and the Lord <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere;</hi> after this Committee had many times ſat, and taken about Fourty Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and Examinations, the Earl of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> were ſent by His Majeſty into the Country, as two of the Lords Commiſſioners to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Army. After theſe two Lords were thus out of Town, the Earl of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von</hi> (being Chairman of the Committee) brought theſe Depoſitions and Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into the Houſe; but it being then late in the day, none were read, but an Order made that they ſhould be read the next Morning; but His Majeſties Affairs Commanded likewiſe the Earl of <hi>Devon</hi> the next Morning to go into the Country; ſo that when theſe Informations were read in the Houſe, not one of the four Lords of this Committee were there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Earl of <hi>Bedford:</hi> Wherefore the Houſe Ordered the Debate of the matter to be ſuſpended, as you have before heard. And thus the Caſe came at firſt before their Lordſhips, and ſo it now ſtands.</p>

               <p>Before I give you any Information to prove my Lord by others barbarouſly Murdered, I think it proper to ſtate the Caſe as it was repreſented by thoſe who would have the World believe my Lord a Self Murderer; for without this you cannot underſtand what uſe can be made of many Informations that have been in this Caſe taken, becauſe you will not be able to ſee wherein they contradict what was ſworn before the Coroner, to prove my Lords ſelf-deſtruction, and whatſoever proves their repreſentation of the matter to the Coroner falſe by a very natural Conſequence, proves my Lords being mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by others.</p>

               <p>I ſhall begin with my Lords Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Tower. The Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Arthur,</hi> late Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Tower the Tenth of <hi>July</hi> 1683. and the firſt night lay at Captain <hi>Cheekes,</hi> the then Lieutenant of the Tower, but the next day was removed to Major <hi>Hawleys,</hi> (then Gentleman Porter of the Tower) and the two Warders placed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Lordſhip were <hi>Nathaniel Munday</hi> and <hi>Thomas Ruſſel,</hi> one to ſtand at my Lords Chamber-door, or in his Chamber, and the other at the Stairs-foot, and thus by turns. <hi>Paul Bomeny,</hi> my Lords Servant, was permitted to be with his Lordſhip. At Mr. <hi>Hawleys</hi> my Lord lay <hi>Wedneſday</hi> night and <hi>Thurſday</hi> night, but <hi>Friday</hi> Morning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Nine of the Clock his Lordſhip was found with his Throat cut through both Jugulars and Arteries, even to the Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone on both ſides the Neck. The next day—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, Pardon this Interruption, I find that my Lord firſt lay at Captain <hi>Cheeks</hi> one night, and then was removed to <hi>Hawleys,</hi> where after two nights his Lordſhip was found dead; how came it to paſs that my Lord had not continued to lye at Captain <hi>Cheeks,</hi> it being very uſual for Priſoners of his Lordſhips Quality to lye at the Leiutenants Houſe, as now my Lord <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> doth at the Lord <hi>Lucas</hi>'s.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>The true Cauſe of this Removal I cannot give you, but the Colour I can; It is pretended that Captain <hi>Cheek</hi> would not be troubled with any Priſoners in his own Houſe; for which reaſon (as pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) his Lordſhip was removed; but this I believe not to be the Cauſe, but (as I ſaid)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41825:7"/>the Colour only; as for the true reaſon hereof, I refer you to the <hi>Men of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy</hi> in this Caſe. But to proceed, The next day being <hi>Saturday,</hi> the Jury ſate, and before them were ſworn the aforeſaid <hi>Paul Bomeny, Thomas Ruſſel,</hi> and the two Chyrurgeons.</p>
               <p>Which Informations are as followeth according to the Print; but that (as I ſhall obſerve in its own proper place) varies from the Original in <hi>Bomeny</hi>'s Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                        <p>SAith, that when my Lord came to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Hawley</hi>'s, which was the 11th in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> asked him for a Penknife to pare his Nails, as he was wont to do, to which this Informant anſwered, being come in haſte, he had not brought it, but he would ſend for one, and accordingly ſent the Footman with a Note for ſeveral things for my Lord, amongſt which the Penknife was inſerted; and the Footman went and gave the Bill to my Lords Steward, who ſent the Proviſions, but not the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife, and he told the Footman he would get one the next day: When the Footman was come, my Lord asked if the Penknife was come, this Informant anſwered No, but he ſhould have it the next day, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he on the 12th inſtant in the morning before my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was up, this Informant ſent the Footman home with a Note to the Steward, in which amongſt other things, he asked for a Penknife for my Lord; and when the Footman was gone about or a little after eight of the Clock, my Lord ſent one Mr, <hi>Ruſſel</hi> his Warder to this Informant, who came, and then he asked him if the Penknife was come, this Informant ſaid, No my Lord, but I ſhall have it by and by, to which my Lord ſaid that he ſhould bring him one of his Raſors, it would do as well; and then this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant went and fetched one, and gave it my Lord, who then went to pare his Nails; and then the Informant went out of the Room into the paſſage by the Door,
<note place="margin">☜</note> 
                           <hi>on Fryday the</hi> 13th <hi>inſtant,</hi> and began to talk with the Warder; and a little while after he went down Stairs. And ſoon after came the Footman with the Proviſions, and brought alſo a Penknife, which this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant put upon his Bed, and thought my Lord had no more need of it, becauſe he thought he had pared his Nails. And then this Informant came up to my Lords Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber about Eight or Nine in the Forenoon <hi>on fryday the</hi> 13th. <hi>inſtant</hi> with a little Note from the Steward; but not finding his Lord in the Chamber, went to the Cloſe ſtool Cloſet Door, and found it ſhut, and thinking his Lord was buſie there, went down and ſtaid a little, and came up again, thinking his Lord had been come out of the Cloſet, and finding him not in the Chamber, he knocked at the Door with his Finger thrice, and ſaid, My Lord? But no body anſwering, he took up the Hanging, and looking through the Chink, he ſaw Blood and parts of the Raſor, whereupon he called the Warder <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and went down to call for help, and the ſaid <hi>Ruſſel</hi> puſhed the Door open, and there they ſaw my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> all along the Floor without a Perriwig, and all full of Blood and the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor by him. And this Deponent further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, that the Raſor now ſhewed to him at the time of his Examination is the ſame Raſor which he did bring to my Lord, and which did lye on the Ground in the Cloſſet by my Lord.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Nathaniel Monday</hi> (the other Warder on my Lord at the time of his Death) now declares, that aſſoon as my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Chamber Door was opened by the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Jaylor about Seven of the Clock, (that morning my Lord died,) he ſtood Warder upon my Lord till about a quarter of an hour before my Lord was found dead, and then he called up <hi>Ruſſel</hi> and left him at the Door, and then went down Stairs, where he had not been a quarter of an hour before <hi>Bomeny</hi> cryed out, My Lord is fallen down ſick; whereupon he ran up Stairs, and found <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to open the Cloſet Door, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could ſtir it, becauſe my Lords body
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41825:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>lay ſo very cloſe and ſtrong againſt the Door; wherefore he being ſtronger than either <hi>Bomeny</hi> or <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> put his Shoulder againſt the Door, and thruſting with all his might broke it open.</p>
            <p>Major <hi>Hawley</hi> (at whoſe houſe my Lord was Murdered,) ſaith, That about Five of the Clock that Morning my Lord died, he went out to open the Tower Gates (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the duty of his place,) and came not home nor nigh his own houſe till about <hi>Nine</hi> of the Clock,

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41825:9"/>forbear to call by its proper Name) have had it made more publick.</p>

               <p>Firſt, as for ſuch Informations as have relation to what paſſed before my Lord's Death, theſe are of two ſorts; the firſt proves a Reſolution (by Papiſts) ſeveral Days before my Lord's Death, to cut my Lord's Throat. The</p>
               <p>Second, Many Reports in ſeveral parts of <hi>England</hi> (before my Lord's Death) that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat in the Tower. For proof of their previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reſolution to cut my Lord's Throat; pray read this Paper which I have taken for my own ſatisfaction, and the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome Friends, from the Perſon's own Mouth.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>D. S.</hi> ſaith, <q>That a little before the Death of the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> as ſhe was Servant in the Houſe of one Mr. <hi>Holmes,</hi> a Papiſt, then living in <hi>Baldwins Gardens</hi> about Nine Days before my Lord's Death, ſome Papiſts (among which one Mr. <hi>Lovet,</hi> whom this Informant knew) met in her ſaid Maſters Houſe, ſhe being then in the Kitchin with one <hi>W. A.</hi> then Apprentice with the ſaid Mr. <hi>Holmes;</hi> the ſaid <hi>W. A.</hi> went a little up ſtairs, and ſtopping, beckoned to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant to come to him, which this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant accordingly did; but the ſaid <hi>W. A.</hi> ſoon went up ſtairs into the Garret (as this Informant ſuppoſes) to work, and left this Informant on the Stairs; and this Informant heard the aforeſaid Papiſts diſcourſing in the Room juſt over the Kitchin, concerning the ſaid Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and the ſubſtance of what ſhe then heard, was to the Effect following <hi>(viz.)</hi> one of them curſing the ſaid Earl, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him Villain and Dog (or ſuch, with ſeveral ſuch approbrious Terms) ſaying, <hi>He knew ſo much of their Deſigns,
<note place="margin">Note</note> and was ſo very averſe to their Intereſt, that unleſs he was taken off, they ſhould never carry them on.</hi> Upon which it was then anſwered by another, That they had been with his <hi>Highneſs,</hi> and his <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> was for <hi>Poyſoning</hi> the ſaid Earl; but his <hi>Highneſs</hi> was told, that manner of Death would not look well to the World; it was then alſo declared, that one had propoſed to his <hi>Highneſs, <hi>Stabbing</hi>
                     </hi> the Earl, but that was likwiſe not agreed on; <hi>at length his</hi> Highneſs <hi>concluded, and ordered his Throat to be cut; and his</hi> Highneſs <hi>had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be</hi> there <hi>when it was done;</hi> (but this Informant remembers not any Place mentioned where the Earl's Throat was to be cut.) This was the Subſtance of what this Informant heard the firſt meeting: But about three Days after ſome of the aforeſaid Perſons met again at the ſaid Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi>'s Houſe, and this Informant liſtned (as before) to their Diſcourſe, and heard one of them ſay, <hi>That the cutting the Earl's Throat was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on, but they would give it out, That he had done it himſelf; and if any ſhould deny it, they would take them up, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them for it.</hi> This Informant further ſaith, That being much troubled in mind
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41825:9"/>for what ſhe had heard, as above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, ſhe was willing to have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to ſome Juſtice of Peace what ſhe kenew, as aforeſaid, being willing the Miſchief, as above-deſigned, might be prevented. Whereupon ſhe went to a Friend of hers to adviſe with <hi>(viz.)</hi> one Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſince dead (who bfore that time had been her Maſter) who lived not far from Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi>'s Houſe, and informed him as before ſet forth. Whereupon the ſaid Mr. <hi>B. did adviſe her to be ſilent; for the Papiſts carrying all before them, ſhe was ruined, if ſhe ſpoke of it.</hi> Upon which ſhe did not to her remembrance then reveal it to any other. This Informant further ſaith, That the very day of my Lord's death ſhe was (not long before Dinner) at a Chandlers (not far from the ſaid <hi>Holme</hi>'s Houſe) <hi>viz.</hi> one Mrs. <hi>Hinton</hi>'s, in <hi>Leather-lane,</hi> where there then came ſome who declared, That the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat in the Tower: upon which ſhe went home to Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi>'s, and was extreamly troubled, and immediately taken with Fits, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as before, heard their Reſolution to cut the Earl's Throat. This Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant further declareth, That about two or three of the Clock the ſame day the Earl died, ſome of the aforeſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult met again at her Maſter <hi>Holmes</hi>'s Houſe, and ſhe heard them leap about the Room; and one of them ſtruck him upon the Back, and cry'd, <hi>The Feat was done (or we have done the Feat.)</hi> Whereupon the ſaid Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, Is the Earl's Throat cut? To which the other anſwered, Yes; <hi>and further ſaid, he could not but laugh to think how like a Fool the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>looked when they came to cut his Throat?</hi> The ſaid Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi> did then ſay, Was his Highneſs there? To which the other Papiſt replied, Yes. This Informant further ſaith, That ſhe did, about four Years ſince, diſcover to one Mr. <hi>R.</hi> (with whom ſhe then lived as a Servant) his Wife and Daughter, That ſhe had heard at Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi>'s Houſe aforeſaid, ſome Papiſts (ſeveral days before my Lord's Death) declare, That the Earl's Throat was to be cut: but her ſaid Maſter <hi>R.</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to hold her peace, and not to tell him ſuch dangerous things, leſt, as he ſaid, being over-heard, ſhe ſhould ruine him, and all his Family, or Words to that effect.</q>

               <p>It's improbable that any ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe a matter of this Conſequence and Secrecy, thus to be over-heard by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>I do hardly know any Houſe more convenient for a ſecret Meeting, provided all the Family be true to the Deſign; and, it's probable, theſe Men did not know that this Maid was a Proteſtant, or that upon the Stairs in the Kitchin their Diſcourſe could be over-heard; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it could be there heard almoſt as plain as in the very Room it ſelf, unleſs you whiſper.</p>

               <p>Beſides, conſider the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Time when this Conſult was held. This was when our Government in its Corruption was grown to ſuch a pitch, that ſome People were <hi>Loyally mad,</hi> and (through blind prejudiced Obedience, I hope, more than Malice) were offering up as Sacrifices to the Court Popiſh and Arbitrary Intereſt the Blood of thoſe brave Men, who did zealouſly oppoſe thoſe curſed Deſigns, the Popiſh and Arbitrary end whereof we then ſaw through a Glaſs, but ſince (to our Coſt) face to face. Should therefore this poor Maid have revealed what ſhe heard, it's ten thouſand to one but this Truth would have met with ſuch a Disbelief in ſome, and ſuch Hatred in others, that through both, it would have been ſeverely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for be ſure theſe bloody Men would have depoſed, and, in probability, by others of their Party, proved, that they at that time were ſomewhere elſe; and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41825:10"/>without all doubt our then Juries would ſooner have credited the many oaths which would, though falſely, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted her Teſtimony, than her own ſingle Evidence: And therefore I think Mr. <hi>Billinger</hi>'s Caution (as before) given this Maid, was grounded upon great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and what would have proved too true ſhould it have been put to the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>R.</hi> his Wife and Daughter do declare, and are ready to depoſe, <q>That about four years ſince the aforeſaid <hi>D.

And the ſaid Mr. <hi>R.</hi> further ſaith, that he did check the ſaid <hi>D. S.</hi> for ſpeaking of it, and would not hear her freely declare what ſhe would have ſaid in that matter, becauſe it would have been of dangerous Conſequence to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Family, ſhould ſuch her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe be over-heard, as it eaſily might by any that might have liſtned at the Window. And the ſaid Mrs. <hi>R.</hi> further ſaith, That the ſaid <hi>D. S.</hi> about four Years ſince did declare, That ſhe could ſay much more than ſhe had to them revealed, and that ſhe did hope ſhe ſhould live to ſee that day wherein ſhe might with ſafety ſpeak the Truth in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</q>

                  <hi>R. M.</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Goldſmith, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, That ſome time after the Death of the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> obſerving <hi>D. S.</hi> to be very melancholy, and much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and troubled in mind, the ſaid <hi>R. M.</hi> deſired the ſaid <hi>D. S.</hi> to tell the reaſon of ſuch her Dejection; but the ſaid <hi>D. S.</hi> at firſt was very unwilling, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, She was afraid to reveal her mind to any. Whereupon the ſaid <hi>R. M.</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed her to diſcover it to ſome particular Friend whom ſhe could ſafely confide in: Upon which the ſaid <hi>D.</hi> replied, <hi>That ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which ſhe knew, with relation to the Death of the late Earl of</hi> Eſſex, <hi>was the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41825:10"/>cauſe of her trouble, and it was not ſafe for her to reveal it</hi> (or words to that effect;) whereupon the ſaid <hi>R. M.</hi> adviſed her not to reveal it to any one, till ſhe might with ſafety. The ſaid <hi>R. M.</hi> farther ſaith, that about <hi>February</hi> laſt, the ſaid <hi>R. M.</hi> finding it ſafe to ask, and no danger to the ſaid <hi>D. S.</hi> to reveal what ſhe knew with relation to the ſaid Earls Death, he then deſired her to inform him what ſhe knew with relation thereunto. Whereupon the ſaid <hi>D. S.</hi> told him ſhe had heard a Conſult before my Lords Death to cut his Throat, and that ſome great Perſon was named at that meeting as concerned in contriving the ſaid Earls death, (or words to that effect;) upon which this Deponent (without being very inquiſitive into particulars,) ſpoke to one Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to acquaint Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> whom the ſaid <hi>R. M.</hi> knew not, nor to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ever ſaw; and ſometime after the ſaid Mr. <hi>T.</hi> told the ſaid <hi>R. M.</hi> that he had ſpoken to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> about it, and that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> did deſire him the ſaid <hi>R. M.</hi> to bring the ſaid <hi>D. S.</hi> to the <hi>Croſs-Keys</hi> in <hi>Watling-ſtreet,</hi> where this Depondent and the ſaid <hi>D. S.</hi> with one Friend of hers more, met the ſaid Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> and Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and then the ſaid <hi>D. S.</hi> gave the ſaid Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account of what ſhe knew with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Earls death. And this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent doth verily believe, that before that time the ſaid <hi>D. S.</hi> never ſaw the ſaid Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> or Mr. <hi>T.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>W. T.</hi> Gent. depoſeth, that about <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> laſt, diſcourſing with one <hi>R. M.</hi> concerning the death of the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the ſaid <hi>R. M.</hi> told this Deponent, that he knew one <hi>D. S.</hi> which could ſay what was material, with relation to the death of the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this Deponent declared, that he would inform Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> of the ſame, of which the ſaid <hi>R. M.</hi> ſeemed very willing and deſirous: This Deponent did ſo accordingly, but the ſaid Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> ſpoke to this effect, <hi>(viz.) That he did believe the Papiſts did endeavour to put ſham-Evidence upon him, which they being able to detect, would from thence argue againſt the truth of all that ſhould be ſaid. And therefore the ſaid Mr.</hi> Braddon <hi>declared, that unleſs the ſaid</hi> D. <hi>appeared to be of good reputation, and that ſhe had ſome years ſince diſcovered what ſhe knew in this Caſe to ſome Friends; ſo that it did appear, that it was not a new contrived Story, either to ſerve the preſent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or to baffle what elſe ſhould be ſworn, he would not believe whatſoever ſhe ſhould ſay, neither would he have her Sworn, whatſoever ſhe declared, unleſs it appeared as above, confirmed by thoſe to whom ſhe revealed it.</hi> This Deponent told the ſaid Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that he knew not the ſaid <hi>D. S.</hi> neither (to his remembrance) had ever ſeen her; But if the ſaid Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> would appoint ſome time and place, he might diſcourſe the ſaid <hi>D. S.</hi> and hear what ſhe could ſay; which the ſaid Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> declared he would do, if he knew where to ſpeak with her; upon which, this Deponent went to the ſaid <hi>R. M.</hi> and deſired the ſaid <hi>R. M.</hi> to bring the ſaid <hi>D. S.</hi> to the Croſs Keys in <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Street</hi> ſuch a day and hour, for there the ſaid Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> and this Deponent ſhould then be. This Deponent further depoſeth, that the ſaid <hi>R. M. D. S.</hi> and another, met this Deponent, and the ſaid Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> accordingly; and this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſaith, that he this Deponent, the ſaid <hi>R. M.</hi> and another Perſon, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent when the ſaid Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſaid <hi>D. S.</hi> who then gave the ſaid Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> a particular account of two meetings of Papiſts ſeveral days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Death, wherein it was declared how the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Throat was to be cut, and by whom or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and likewiſe of what paſſed the day the Earl dyed, at the ſame houſe where they met before his Death. This Deponent further depoſeth, that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> then ſpoke to the ſaid <hi>D. S.</hi> to this effect, That unleſs ſhe could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Perſons of very good Reputation, to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41825:11"/>whom ſhe had ſome years before revealed it, he would look upon it as a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived Story, either to ſerve the intereſt of the Government, or invented to baffle what elſe ſhould be ſworn; for though it was of very dangerous conſequence to reveal it, yet he could not believe ſhe had been ſo ſecret in it as not to reveal it to any; and thereupon this Deponent heard the ſaid <hi>D.S.</hi> declare ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it to ſeveral which ſhe named, but ſhe was by all cautioned to Secreſy, as ſhe valued her ſafety. The ſaid <hi>D. S.</hi> did then further declare to the effect fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>viz.</hi> That for ſome time after my Lord's Death it did extreamly trouble her, and ſhe went to a Divine for his Advice in the matter, for ſhe was extreamly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to think that the Papiſts ſhould lay the Earls death to his own charge, when ſhe had (as before) heard how they themſelves had reſolved to cut his Throat; but the ſaid Divine told her, (as ſhe then ſaid) ſhe muſt be quiet and ſilent in the matter, till ſuch times ſhould come, wherein ſhe might with ſafety reveal it. This Deponent farther depoſeth, that he (to his beſt remembrance) never ſaw the ſaid <hi>D. S.</hi> before this Meeting. And this Deponent doth verily believe, that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> never ſaw the ſaid <hi>D.

               <p>I have often heard Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> declare, that he never heard of the ſaid <hi>D. S.</hi> before Mr. <hi>T.</hi> (as before) Inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of her, and this he would Depoſe if thereto called.</p>

               <p>I think that matter is as plainly proved as the thing is capable of; for no man can Swear poſſitively (beſides Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>) that Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> never heard of, or ſaw the ſaid <hi>D.</hi> but through the Information of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> but by all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as before depoſed by Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and <hi>T.</hi> he never did.</p>

Now neither of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formants being poſitive as to the time, but Mr. <hi>T.</hi> being more inclin'd to believe it to be in <hi>January,</hi> and Mr. <hi>M.</hi> thinking it was the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> each be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Swear as himſelf believeth (as to the time) thus came the ſeeming difference. Beſides, when a man ſpeaks of an action to be done about ſuch a Year, Month, or Week, certainly (in common accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) about a Year, includes either the very Year, or the Year before or after; and about ſuch a Month, either the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Month, or the Month before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>What can you ſay in Contradiction to theſe Depoſitions, either of which being true, your pretended Conſult falls down to the ground, and your firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence proved falſe?

               <p>The Law concludes the ſame in all Civil Actions; for inſtance, he that is ſued upon a Bond, and Pleads <hi>non eſt factum,</hi> or <hi>ſolvit ad diem,</hi> or a Releaſe, or a former Recovery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whatſoever ſuch general Iſſuable Plea is pleaded, and the Plaintiff denies this Plea to be true, and thereupon the truth hereof being tryed, if what is pleaded appears falſe, the Law immediately gives Judgment againſt the Defendant; for its to be ſuppoſed, that every man will firſt plead the beſt, (and conſequently the trueſt) Plea he can in bar of the Action; and if his firſt Plea proves falſe, its preſumed he can give no true and juſt Cauſe to exclude the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff his Action; for if he could, he would firſt have pleaded it.</p>

               <p>The ſame holds good upon Criminal Proſecutions, for if a man ſhall be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (though but upon ſuſpicion) of having committed a Robbery within two miles of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> ſuch a day, upon ſuch a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Gelding, and to avoid this Charge, the Priſoner pretends he was never within Thirty miles of <hi>Salisbury</hi> in his life; and he likewiſe produces ſome, (not of the beſt Reputation) who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that for Ten days before that Robbery, and as long after, the Priſoner being very ſick, kept his Chamber, and ſtirred not out of it; if in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to this, it be poſitively ſworn by Perſons of undoubted Credit, who well knew the Priſoner, that the very day of the Robbery committed, within a very ſhort time before the Robbery ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been committed, they met the Priſoner nigh the place where, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Piiſoners Gelding, and all other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, in his Cloaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> agreeing with the deſcription the Proſecutor gave, I ſay, if this be credibly proved in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the Priſoners Defence, it cannot but ſatisfy any Judge and Jury, that the Priſoner is really Guilty; neither are they to anſwer at the laſt day for his Blood, ſhould he prove innocent, but his Blood ſhall be required at his own hands, ſeeing by his falſe Defence he became a Self-deſtroyer, according to the common Judgement of all Mankind.

               <p>Innocence is naturally ſuſpected as Guilt, when the falſity of its Defence is detected; for if a Perſon of a very ill Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation charged a Man with a Crime, if I knew the Diſreputation of the Accuſer, the bare denyal of the Accuſed might more influence my Belief, than the Oath of the Proſecutors; but if once I found the Priſoner falſe in his Defence, that Charge which before I disbelieved as falſe, I ſhould then immediately as firmly credit for Truth; but I deſire to know what can be ſaid in anſwer to theſe Counter-evidences.</p>

               <p>When Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> found that <hi>Holmes</hi> endeavoured to prove (as before ſworn by <hi>Hewit</hi>) himſelf out of Town from the 6th of <hi>July</hi> 1683, to the 26th or 27th of the ſame Month Mr. <hi>B.</hi> did endeavour to enquire out all ſuch as either Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi> or Mrs. <hi>Hewit</hi> were well known to or traded with, and therefore he made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after all thoſe with whom (in that Month and Year) they bought of or ſold to all Shopkeepers, Taylors, Butchers, Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, Shoemakers, Hatters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſuch as upon inquiry he received ſuch Characters of, as he might expect fair ſatisfaction from, he did deſire to ſee their Books in that Month of <hi>July,</hi> to ſee whether any Goods were bought in Town by the ſaid Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi> or Mrs. <hi>Hewit,</hi> (for proving <hi>Hewit</hi> in Town, proves <hi>Holmes</hi> likewiſe in Town, becauſe its ſworn and can be prov'd, they both went out of Town together,) or any Money paid between the 6th and 26th of <hi>July,</hi> by either of theſe.

               <p>As ſoon as Mrs. <hi>Hewit</hi> underſtood ſuch a Taylors entry was againſt her Oath, ſhe with <hi>Holmes</hi>'s Wife went to this Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and deſired to ſee his Book, which being ſhewed, <hi>Hewit</hi> firſt pretended that this Entry was forged and new; but when Mr. <hi>W.</hi> declared he could ſafely, and would depoſe that the Entry was real, it was then pretended that the Gown was ſent into the Country after Mrs. <hi>Hewit;</hi> but when in anſwer to that, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared he could depoſe, that Mrs. <hi>Hewit</hi> was in Town when that Duſt-Gown was made and delivered, and that ſhe then pretended ſhe was about going into the Countrey, (but how many days after ſhe did go, he could not tell.) Mrs. <hi>Hewit</hi> told him if he did Swear that, he would take off her Brothers life, and <hi>Holmes</hi>'s Blood would be upon his head.</p>

               <p>This is a Villanous and Falſe Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, to prevent the detection of Blood, and evade the puniſhment for the vileſt Murder. I am ſure of this, if Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſhould upon Oath deny what he can with ſafety aſſert, he would draw the guilt of Perjury on his Head. And not only ſo,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41825:14"/>but this Perjury being in protection of a Murder, to that Perjury, he would add the guilt of my Lord's Blood, ſeeing by that Perjury he doth endeavour to ſtifle the Diſcovery, and prevent the Proſecution of the moſt Treacherous, Barbarous and Cruel Murder (in all circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd) our Nation ever knew. If he that protects a Murderer (being well aſſured that he is ſuch) in his Houſe, to avoid the common methods of Juſtice, deſerves in our Law to anſwer this Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, (which makes him acceſſary after the fact) with nothing leſs than his Life. How much more criminal (before God) is he that by Perjury endeavours to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Execution of Juſtice upon the the like offender; the firſt doth an action in it ſelf abſtracted from the end hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, nay, it may be charitable, and his intentions (which argues his after aſſent to the Murder,) renders him a Criminal. But the ſecond commits one of the greateſt Tranſgreſſions (which in it ſelf deſerves almoſt Death,) with the ſame ill deſign as the firſt; wherefore moſt certainly he is the greateſt Criminal of the two, by that addition of Perjury to the ſame offence. And though our Law in this caſe puniſh not the ſecond Offender with Death, yet I am ſure (and I think all men will own) that the ſecond moſt deſerves it.</p>

               <p>I think the Taylors Book before obſerved, and the words of a Dying-man will be ſufficient to convince all mankind.

               <p>The Doctrine (I think) is both true and plain, and I will give you an inſtance ſomewhat like this. A Gentlman ſuch a day very early in the morning was found Murdered between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Highgate,</hi> with one Glove lying by the Body, and not any Perſon at the firſt by his Relations particularly ſuſpected for the Murderer; at length upon diligent Inquiry, it was found out (about Two Months after the Death,) that a certain Gentleman had ſworn he would Murder the Deceaſed, if he could ever meet with an opportunity. Upon this ſuſpition he was taken up, the Priſoner denies the fact, and in particular ſaith, that he could make it appear by two (then preſent) how that two days before this Murder he went to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and tarried there till Ten days after, and ſuch a day, he with his Two Friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>London,</hi> (which Two Friends being then there, declared they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to Depoſe the ſame. A Gentleman juſt then coming in, who knew and was very well acquainted with the Priſoner, having been inform'd of his Defence, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reflected upon this Defence, and knew it to be falſe, for this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with three others, (all knowing the Priſoner) very betimes the very morning the Murder was committed, (which was of a remarkable day) were walking out in <hi>Lambs-Conduit</hi> Fields, there and then met the Priſoner, (with another Perſon a Stranger to them) to whom they ſpoke, and he to them; and a little after the Priſoner, was his Spaniel running with a Fringe Glove in his Mouth; this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being well known to the Dog, calls the Dog, and takes from him the Glove, puts it in his Pocket, and carries it home. This Gentleman therefore knowing this Defence to be falſe, concluded (as he naturally might) that the charge was true, and hereupon (though with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy, becauſe the Priſoner was his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, but not dearer to him then his love to Juſtice,) declares what you have before heard, and fetches the Glove and his two Friends, and all depoſe (in contradiction to the Priſoners Defence what you have before heard related, and the Glove appeared to be the Glove of the Perſon Murdered, and Fellow to that found by the Body.) And now I deſire to know of you what you think of this Gentleman (who thus falſified the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,) did he do the duty of an honeſt man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Truly I believe he did, and was to be commended for ſo doing, though the Priſoner was his Acquaintance, for Juſtice obliged him to it, and <hi>Iuſtice knows neither Acquaintance; Relation or Friend.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>But do you not think that this Gentleman <hi>(in foro Conſcientiae)</hi> had been conſenting to this Murder, had he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Priſoner by ſuch a forged Defence (which he well knew to be falſe) to baffle the Proſecution.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>By his ſilence he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Murder, and (negatively at leaſt) protected the Priſoner from that juſt Puniſhment which both the Law of God and Man juſtly inflicts for ſuch an offence.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Upon the whole matter, I think you have rather loſt then got any ground by thoſe Depoſitions upon which you ſo much rely'd, to falſify <hi>D. S.</hi> Teſtimony; and that which you have brought to deſtroy, hath ſtrengthened her Evidence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41825:15"/>gives credit to the truth of that moſt Barbarous Murder.</p>

               <p>For my own part I am very well ſatisfied, that <hi>D. S.</hi> hath depoſed the truth; for how can it be thought that ſhe ſhould declare ſo long ſince that ſhe knew of this Conſult, if ſhe had not indeed heard it; her very ſaying it, would have gone nigh (as it would then have been managed <hi>per fas aut nefas,</hi> to have coſt her life; and to believe that ſhe would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard her life to a Lye, can't enter into my thoughts. And therefore I am verily perſwaded that nothing but the power of truth made her ſpeak in this matter.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>It appears ſworn by <hi>Hewit,</hi> that <hi>D. S.</hi> threatned Mrs. <hi>Holmes</hi> with Revenge when ſhe was turned away.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>For this you have the Oath of one who is ſufficiently detected of a falſity in two other particulars; and therefore not in this or any thing elſe to be credited.</p>

               <p>Had ſhe deſigned any Revenge, ſhe would have ſworn more home upon Mr. <hi>Holmes,</hi> for when ſhe was asked whether ſhe did remember that Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi> was in the Room either of the Two Meetings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Lord's Death, ſhe declared ſhe would not ſwear it, becauſe ſhe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred not that ſhe had heard him there; but all that ſhe could poſitively ſwear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, was what paſſed after my Lord's Death, <hi>(viz.) When Mr.</hi> Holmes <hi>came into the Room about Three of the Clock that day my Lord dyed, one ſtrikes him upon the Back, and crys we have done the feat; upon which Mr.</hi> Holmes <hi>ſaid, What is the Earls Throat cut, to which the other replied yes, and further ſaid, he could not but laugh to think how like a Fool the Earl looked when they came to cut his Throat;</hi> upon <hi>Holmes</hi>'s Queſtion, it was plain he well underſtood the meaning of that expreſſion, <hi>the Feat was done,</hi> or otherwiſe he could not ſo readily have hit the thing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Can it be ſuppoſed Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi> would at Three of the Clock that day my Lord Dy'd, ask whether my Lord's Throat was cut, when it had been from Eleven of the Clock that day in every mans mouth; and conſequently <hi>Holmes</hi> could not but believe without any further inquiry at that time of the day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>What <hi>Holmes</hi> here ſpoke by way of Interrogation, might be intended as a ſtrong affirmation of what ſeemed to be asked, and this you can't wonder at; Have you forgot that common Figure? <hi>Quaerit Eroteſis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Is not this the Carpenters Son? Is not this he</hi> (ſpeaking of St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that deſtroyed them which called on his Name at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in both theſe, the thing is moſt ſtrongly affirmed. A Thouſand ſuch inſtances might be given. Or it's poſſible that <hi>D. S.</hi> might miſtake; for whereas ſhe ſaith, that <hi>Holmes</hi> ſaid, What is the Earls Throat cut? which makes it an Interrogation, the Expreſſion might be, What the Earls Throat is cut, and this makes it a poſitive Affirmation. Here the words are the very ſame, only in the firſt, the Copula is placed before the Subject, and in the laſt juſt before the Predicate.</p>

               <p>I muſt confeſs if either of theſe have ſworn true, or the dying man ſpoke truth, this truth is a very ſtrong confirmation of her Teſtimony, and I cannot well disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve theſe Five, ſeeing they do all ſo well agree in their Evidence; for Five ſwear <hi>Smith</hi> was there about Peas time, which muſt be after <hi>April.</hi> I ſhall detain you no longer upon this particular, but deſire you to proceed.</p>

<note place="margin">Note</note> (though all thoſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where the Report was before my Lord's death, that my Lord had cut his Throat in the Tower, could not at the time of this Report be preſumed to have been informed of my Lord's being in the Tower) I ſay all theſe Reports jump in one and the ſame manner of Self mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and all agree in the Place where, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Tower. This clearly proves, that ſome days before my Lord's very
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41825:17"/>Commitment to the Tower, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, not only that my Lord ſhould be murdered in the General, but likewiſe the Particular manner how, and the Place where reſolved upon. For how could <hi>Froome</hi> (being a Hundred Miles from <hi>London</hi>) hear <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Morning the 11th of <hi>July,</hi> of my Lords being Priſoner in the Tower; when his Lorſhip was not ſent to the Tower till the day before (being the 10th in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon: Or how could this Commitment be well heard of at <hi>Andover</hi> (about Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Miles from <hi>London</hi>) on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (<hi>Tueſdays</hi> Poſt not being there till <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday</hi> in the Afternoon) when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment was not till the <hi>Tueſday</hi> in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon; and yet at both theſe Places, this very <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Morning, was it reported that the Earl had cut his Throat in the Tower.</p>

               <p>'To me 'tis beyond all doubt from what before appears, that the Tower muſt be fixed upon as the place, where this perfidious Cruelty was to be acted, before my Lord was Priſoner in the Tower, and the particular manner concluded in, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the Reports as to the manner how, and place where, would have differed.</p>

               <p>Upon the beſt Inquiry I could make, and the moſt probable reaſon I can give (how this came ſo reported in the Country, before it was indeed done) is this: It was reſolved upon, as <hi>D.

Now thoſe that were privy to the whole Secret, and were willing to oblige their Country Correſpondents and Friends with this (to that bloody Party) grateful reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, That the Earl's Throat was to be cut in the Tower, and laid to his own Charge; and this to be done either ſoon after his firſt Commitment, or upon my Lord <hi>Ruſſell</hi>'s Tryal (which was put off ſome ſhort time) ſuch as had received ſo weighty Intelligence were likewiſe willing and ready, partly out of a deſire to oblige their Friends in the Country, (to whom this Deſign might be as acceptable) and partly out of an Itch of telling News, and of being the firſt in the Country that gave Information of this (to them glad-tidings) not doubting but my Lord's Throat was indeed cut, when it was firſt reſolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be cut, <hi>(viz.)</hi> either upon his firſt Commitment (which they might ſuppoſe would have been before it was, all things being ſo reſolv'd upon) or upon my Lord <hi>Ruſſell</hi>'s Tryal (which was to have been before it was, but put off, of which theſe Country — Intelligencers might not hear.) Theſe (I ſay) being informed that the matter was thus laid, concluded the thing was done as it was ſo deſigned to be done, and ſo reported the thing as done before it was indeed done.</p>

               <p>This looks as though the Story were made after my Lord's Death, for the King and Duke went not to the Tower till <hi>Friday</hi> Morning, and their then going was altogether a ſurprize to the whole Town: And after the Earl's Death their being then there occaſioned very groſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, ſeeing they had not been. (as I have been credibly informed) above twice
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41825:17"/>together in the Tower ſince the Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now that this unfortunate Action (the Earl's Death) ſhould be cloathed in the very ſame circumſtances) as afterwards pretended to be done, not only as to the Manner how,
<note place="margin">☞</note> the Place where, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Reaſon wherefore; which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſets forth the King and Duke's being in the Tower when the Earl did it, and done to avoid ſeeing his Majeſty; for the Earl (as was ſaid) was afraid the King would have come up into his Chamber and ſeen him; but the King and Duke's being in the Tower could neither be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen nor expected; this, I ſay, makes <hi>F</hi>'s Evidence ſcarce credible.</p>

               <p>Neither the Cutting the Earl's Throat, or the place where it was to be done, or who was to be there, (<hi>viz.</hi> the King and Duke) when it was to be done, could be either foreſeen or expected by any but thoſe who either laid this bloody Scene, or were privy by Information to its contrivance, and ſuch as well knew, or had been informed how this matter was reſolved upon, may well be ſuppoſed capable of giving a particular Information of this cruel Tragedy.</p>

               <p>I do well remember that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Morning my Lord dy'd there was a ſmall Paper cry'd about of the Earl's Death, wherein it was ſo repreſented, and the common report of the Town then was, That the Earl cut his Throat, for the ſame reaſon ſo long before aſſigned by the report at <hi>Andover.</hi> I muſt confeſs this is very aſtoniſhing, and whoſoever believes <hi>F</hi>'s Evidence only, muſt from ſuch a belief be fully aſſured, not only that the Earl's Throat was deſigned to be cut; but likewiſe that it was contrived to be done in the ſame circumſtances it was afterwards acted under, for elſe it could not poſſibly be ſo circumſtantially report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before my Lords Death; not only as to the <hi>How</hi> and the <hi>Where,</hi> but likewiſe the <hi>Wherefore</hi> given out before it was done.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, I perceive you are both extremely ſurprized with this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Evidence of <hi>F.</hi> as what looks like an after made Story, ſeeing the Earl's Death was here ſo long before reported, as afterwards it was pretended to be acted, both as to the Circumſtances of the King and Duke's being in the Tower, and the Conſideration that (was pretended) then moved the Earl hereunto <hi>(viz.)</hi> fear of the King's coming into his Chamber, and ſeeing him, which his guilt and ſhame (as was pretended) would not bear the thoughts of: But to confirm this Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you will hereafter hear others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſame; in the mean time I deſire you would compare this with that part of <hi>D. S.</hi> Evidence, which declares, That Nine days before the Earl's Death it was declared, that the <hi>Duke</hi> had concluded and ordered his Throat to be cut;
<note place="margin">☜</note> 
                  <hi>And his Highneſs had promiſed to be There</hi> when it was done. Now it would have looked more directly upon his <hi>Highneſs,</hi> ſhould he alone have gone into the Tower that Morning; and therefore as a colour to that pretended reaſon for the ſelf-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a Skreen to his <hi>Highneſs,</hi> his Majeſty muſt be perſwaded to go down likewiſe; ſo that if any ſhould ſay the Earl was Murthered, it ſhould be eſteemed a Reflection upon his Majeſty, who was then in the Tower, as though his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had gone to the Tower that Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Murther the Earl. Thus we find the matter managed by the Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Attorney-General at Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>'s Tryal, almoſt throughout the Tryal.</p>

               <p>I perceive then that you do not think <hi>Charles</hi> the Second had any Hand in contriving this Murther.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>I do not, I aſſure you; but rather the contrary, upon very good reaſons, which you will hereafter be ſatisfied in, for I ſhall mention them in their proper place. But I do verily believe, that ſome ſhort time before the King's Death, his Majeſty was perſwaded the Earl was Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered; and had his Majeſty lived ſix Months longer, it's very probable you might long ſince have ſeen this detecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>I have ſome reaſon for the ſame belief: For I do well remember about ſix Months after the late King's Death, I was credibly told this Story; my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Jefferyes</hi> not long after that King's Death was at ſome publick place, where he took an occaſion to ſpeak very large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in praiſe of his Majeſty, then lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed; and after he had made a very long harangue in his praiſe, his Lordſhip turned about and whiſpered a Gentleman in the Ear (whom he thought his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) ſaying, <hi>If the King had lived ſix Months longer, we had been all Hanged, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what I have ſaid.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>The meaſure of his Lordſhip's Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity was not then full.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>It ſeems not; but every Man muſt believe his Lordſhip's meaſure was very large, or otherwiſe the great quantity of innocent blood therein powered by his vile Injuſtice, had long before his Death made it run over.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>I do very much wonder (admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Earl was Murthered, which I am now almoſt brought to the belief of) how it ſhould thus become generally reported in ſo many places before his Death.</p>

               <p>This <hi>almoſt</hi> will ſhortly be an <hi>alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> and you will in this be throughly perſwaded of the truth of this barbarous Murther; for I have reaſon to think, much more will be ſaid to prove it, becauſe there are ſo many Witneſſes of which we have as yet had no account.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>The reaſon of its being ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reported before it was done, you will not ſo much admire at, if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the Circumſtances of this Action. This Murther was not acted out of any private Motive, to ſome private End; it was not done for the ſatisfaction of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal revenge: No, this was a branch of that Curſed, Arbitrary, and Popiſh Deſign againſt our Civil and Religious Rights at that time carried on with all the fury ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable under colour of ſupporting the Engliſh Monarchy and Church of <hi>England,</hi> both which were then falſly ſaid to be threatned with Ruin by that Party, of which that truly Noble, but unfortunate Lord, was marked (out) as one of the Chief: I ſay this was done to remove a Chief Obſtacle to that Popiſh and Arbitrary end, the true Enemies of both Church and State were then carrying on; for you find it Sworn by <hi>D. S</hi> that ſeveral days before the Earl's Death, the Papiſts curs'd him as one who knew much of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, (which he could not be ignorant of obſerving though with hatred) from thoſe high Poſts he had been imployed in) and was ſo very averſe to their Intereſt, that unleſs he was taken off, <hi>they ſhould never carry them on.</hi> The carrying on their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, Arbitrary, and Deviliſh Deſign you ſee was by themſelves aſſigned as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this moſt perfidious and barbarous Cruelty; ſo that this Murther was a branch of their Plot, and conſequently might be ſuppoſed to be known to many; All which have not been Men of the greateſt ſecrecy, witneſs their Reports of the Fire of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> ſo long before it came to paſs; and their giving an Account of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi>'s Death in the Country, before we could be aſſured of the ſame in Town, the Body, not being then found.

               <p>For my own part, I can waſh my hands from the blood of any of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Gentlemen which ſuffered for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to oppoſe thoſe Arbitrary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, which the Charitable opinion moſt men had in the then Court could not at that time believe to be true, but to our great Danger and Coſt we have ſince ſeen them appear more bare-faced; and thoſe very men who eſteemed it Damnable to draw the Sword in defence of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and Civil Rights, though never ſo groſly Invaded, have ſince altered both their Opinion and Practice, and could now weep over the Duſt of thoſe whoſe Perſons they eſteemed not deſerving of life.

This Informant perſwaded the ſaid <hi>Lloyd</hi> to diſcharge his Conſcience to God and Man, and tell what he knew with relation thereunto, leſt by his denial or ſilence, he ſhould draw the guilt of that Innocent Blood upon himſelf; but the ſaid <hi>Lloyd</hi> for ſometime perſiſted in his denial, and whilſt the ſaid <hi>Lloyd</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying his letting in any men into my Lord that Morning my Lord Died, before his Death, there was brought into the Room one Major <hi>Webſter</hi> (as this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant afterwards underſtood him to be,) then Priſoner for the ſame matter. This Informant did thereupon ask the ſaid <hi>Lloyd</hi> whether he knew the ſaid <hi>Webſter,</hi> which the ſaid <hi>Lloyd</hi> denied, and ſaid, he never ſaw him before in his life; upon which this Informant ſaid, it was very much that the ſaid <hi>Lloyd</hi> ſhould not know or remember to have ſeen the ſaid <hi>Webſter</hi> who was his Neighbour, and very noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the place where he lived. But the ſaid <hi>Lloyd</hi> perſiſted for ſome ſhort time in his denial of any knowledge of the ſaid <hi>Webſter;</hi> but ſoon after, the ſaid <hi>Lloyd</hi> took this Informant by the hand,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41825:19"/>and wringing this Informant's Hand, with Tears in his Eyes, ſpoke to this effect. Maſter I give you a Thouſand thanks for your good Advice,
<note place="margin">☞</note> and I do now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by ſpecial order of Major <hi>Hawley</hi> I did let in two or three men (but to the beſt of my remembrance three) into my Lord's Lodgings that morning my Lord dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a very ſhort time before his death; and that man (pointing to <hi>Webſter</hi>) was one of the three Men I did ſo let in; upon which this Informant told the ſaid <hi>Lloyd,</hi> it was very ſtrange he ſhould pretend that <hi>Webſter</hi> was one of three Men he had let into my Lords Lodgings juſt before his death, when the ſaid <hi>Lloyd</hi> had a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pretended that he never ſaw the ſaid <hi>Webſter</hi> before that time. This Informant further ſpoke to the ſaid <hi>Lloyd</hi> to this effect, That as the ſaid <hi>Lloyd</hi> was conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Lords Death, in caſe he did endeavour to ſtifle any truth which might tend to the Diſcovery of my Lords Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo would the ſaid <hi>Lloyd</hi> be guilty of <hi>Webſter</hi>'s Blood, if he ſhould charge him in this particular with a Lye; for what Jury ſoever ſhould believe that <hi>Webſter</hi> was one of thoſe let into my Lord juſt before his Death (it having been by all deny'd that any were ſo let in,) would likewiſe believe that <hi>Webſter</hi> was one of the Ruffians that Murdered his Lordſhip; and therefore this Informant adviſed the ſaid <hi>Lloyd</hi> to be very careful in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Whereupon <hi>Lloyd</hi> replied, that he could be very poſitive in the Man, and if he were even then to dye, he could ſafely and truly charge him upon his Oath with it. This Informant further ſaith, that <hi>Lloyd</hi> did then further declare, that as ſoon as he had let in thoſe men into my Lords Lodgings, he did hear ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral (and he did ſuppoſe them to be thoſe he ſo let in,) go up Stairs into my Lord's Chamber, where there immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enſued a very great noiſe and tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and thereupon ſomewhat thrown down like the fall of a Man; not long after which, it was cried out that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat. <hi>Lloyd</hi> did fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declare, that he did not remember that he ſaw thoſe men go out of Major <hi>Hawley</hi>'s Houſe, but he did believe they might tarry ſome time in the Houſe, till the Croud came in upon the Diſcovery of my Lord's Death, and then went out with the Croud.</q>

This Informant then told the ſaid <hi>Lloyd,</hi> the like he had confeſſed to this Informant and ſeveral others; and even before the Juſtice of Peace had owned it under his Hand; but if it were falſe, he ought to retract it, and be ſorry for having ſaid it; <hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> a little after my Lord's Murder, was informed of a Perſon (if I miſtake not, he was ſaid to be a Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) who likewiſe ſaw thoſe Ruffians as they came out of the houſe, juſt before my Lord's death was known, and obſerved ſome Blood upon one of their Cloaths, but having been often ſearch'd in the King's Bench Priſon, and in a hurry forced to convey away his Papers, he loſt the name and place of abode of this man.</p>

               <p>That's a great misfortune; but if this diſcourſe comes to the hand of that Perſon, or any that have heard him declare what is above related, or any thing elſe material in this matter, they are deſired to ſend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> from whom a letter being left at <hi>Richara</hi>'s Coffee-houſe nigh <hi>Temple Bar,</hi> it will come ſafely and ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his hands.</p>

<note place="margin">☞</note> but nevertheleſs declared ſuch his confeſſion to be true, but it was what he ſhould not have owned. This looks as though there were ſome cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Confederacy entred into for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of truth.</p>

               <p>I were never ſo wedded to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a Fact through prejudice or miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, but upon a full and clear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of my miſtake, did readily renounce my firſt belief, and cleave to the beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, or at leaſt that which to me ſeemed the trueſt; and to deal plainly with you, I did not think ſo much could be ſaid to prove what many Induſtriouſly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to perſwade me was falſe. But there comes even now into my mind, an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt this <hi>Lloyds</hi> confeſſion, which will I think deſtroy it's credit with all Men. If I miſtake not, you told me this <hi>Lloyd</hi> at Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Tryal upon Oath denyed the letting in any Men before my Lords death.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis very true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>How then can any man give credit to this confeſſion, which is a point blank con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to his former Oath. Nay if <hi>Lloyd</hi> upon Oath aſſerted what before he had forſworn, I could not barely upon the credit of his Oath believe it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Barely upon the credit of <hi>Lloyd,</hi> I ſhould hardly believe any thing; only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the Confeſſion of every man though ten times perjured, is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt himſelf. But farther, pray reflect on the Circumſtances of <hi>Lloyd</hi>'s firſt Oath, and you will find in ſeveral reſpects he ſtood prejudiced, ſo that his firſt Oath could not be of equal credit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> his now Confeſſion. For admitting my Lord was Murdered by thoſe men ſo let in, either <hi>Lloyd</hi> was privy to the Murder, or he was not; if he were privy,
<note place="margin">☜</note> then he ſwore to ſave himſelf; if he were not privy to the deſigned Murder, or knew any thing of it, till after the fact was done, then could he not but expect, that the ſame principles backed with the ſame power which Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my Lord, would have likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed him, ſhould he have declared what he knew in the matter; therefore the fear of being hanged in the one caſe, and the danger of a ſtab or the like in the other, were powerful Arguments with this Sentinel. I do grant no man (upon any conſideration whatſoever,) ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced to Perjury, but yet I deſire never to fall under ſo ſtrong temptations. You can't therefore but confeſs this Sentinel at the time of Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Trial was under a ſtrong prejudice to deny what he might in this caſe know, and that for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before alledged; wherefore compare the circumſtances of his Confeſſion with what he afterwards declared, under a great Injunction of Secreſy; <hi>(viz.)
<note place="margin">☜</note> That he was troubled night and day, he had confeſſed the letting in theſe men, for though it was indeed true, he ſhould not have confeſſed.</hi> Conſider truth becomes not a Lye by being deny'd, (though upon Oath,) nor a Lye a Truth by being ſworn. Wherefore all circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces conſidered, you have much ſtronger reaſons to believe <hi>Lloyd</hi>'s now Confeſſion, than his former Oath. But that there were ſome Men let into my Lord, and were
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41825:20"/>buſtling with his Lordſhip juſt before his Death, appears more clearly from this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation following, which I deſire you to Read.</p>

               <p>That's very true, it was to ſave a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but not of Blood or Affinity, but a Civil Parent, the cruel Father of us all, the late <hi>K.</hi> I mean. For the caſe ſtood thus; this Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> had been Nurſe to ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts of Quality, and others where that Infamous <hi>Madam Midnight, Madam</hi> Wilks had been Midwife; and this Mrs. <hi>Wilks</hi> had pretended a great kindneſs to this Nurſe, and had aſſured her ſhe would get her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Court to be Nurſe to ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Eminent Quality, which this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thought might be much for her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and therefore when Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> firſt ſpoke to her, and asked her whether ſhe was in the Tower that Morning the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> died, ſhe anſwered (ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under ſome ſurpriſe and diſorder,) Yes. Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> then deſired to know
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41825:21"/>what ſhe either heard or ſaw with relation to that unfortunate Lords death; ſhe very ſhortly replied Nothing; whereupon Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> (who before had diſcourſed Mr. <hi>P.</hi>) told her either ſhe was a Liar or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, a Liar if ſhe did not ſee and hear that which was material with Relation to my Lords Death, ſeeing ſhe decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the contrary juſt after my Lords Death to Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and his Wife; or very unjuſt, if what ſhe had formerly declared were true, and would not now reveal it; ſhe ſaid ſhe would have nothing to do with it, and ſo flings up Stairs. But Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> being ſhortly after informed that this Woman had declared it was againſt her Intereſt this Murder ſhould be diſcovered and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, <hi>becauſe it would be fixed upon King</hi> James, whoſe return and ſettlement ſhe deſired, for Madam <hi>Wilks</hi> had promiſed her as before declared; and therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mrs. <hi>Wilks</hi> would have no intereſt in caſe this Murder were diſcovered, and ſo ſhe ſhould looſe a very great Friend. She was reſolved not to tell what ſhe knew, nor would have any thing to do in the matter. Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> being thus informed, deſired once more to ſee this Nurſe; when he ſaw her, he told her he did underſtand that there was ſomewhat which ſtood as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt her revealing what ſhe knew, but he declared that he would move the Honourable Committee of Lords, that ſhe might be brought to the Bar of the Houſe of Lords and Sworn, where ſhe ſhould either perjure her ſelf in the concealing of what ſhe knew, in doing whereof, ſhe would not only be guilty of Perjury (when ſworn to diſcover the truth,) but to that Perjury would add Blood, (for which at the laſt day ſhe muſt expect to anſwer;) for could ſhe reveal any thing with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this Murder, and ſtifled it, ſhe by ſuch her ſilence conſented to the Blood of my Lord; and how clear ſoever ſhe might eſcape the puniſhment of our Law, ſhe could not but expect ſhe muſt anſwer it before him who poſitively requires Blood for Blood, and that all Governments ſhould make diligent Inquiſition for the Blood of the ſlain, or otherwiſe he would require that Blood (thus buried through neglect) at the hands of ſuch Majeſtrates as were difficient in their Inquiry, and more ſtrictly would he one day reckon with thoſe that could detect the Murder, but refuſed to reveal it; for upon ſuch more eſpecially would the guilt lye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Majeſtrate can make no diſcovery but by Information; and therefore thoſe that refuſed or neglected to give their Information, would moſt certainly one day ſeverely anſwer for ſuch their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Such Diſcourſe as this Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> had with this Woman before ſeveral others; after which Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> deſired to know whether ſhe would go volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily or upon motion, be brought to the Houſe, for he was reſolved ſhe ſhould be Sworn. Hereupon ſhe declared, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe muſt be ſworn, ſhe would rather go willingly than through ſuch compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and then went accordingly, after which ſhe declared what you have before heard, whereas before ſhe was ſworn ſhe would reveal nothing.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>This is a great Argument both of the truth of her Evidence, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of the Woman, who rather than ſacrifice her Conſcience by Perjury, would ſacrifice (what ſhe really believed to be) her Intereſt.</p>

               <p>It is very probable that <hi>Lloyd</hi> did hear Murder cry'd out; for it's hardly poſſible to be otherwiſe, becauſe it ſeems Murder was cry'd out thrice very loud, and very dolefully; but ſhould <hi>Lloyd</hi> have confeſſed that he let in theſe three Men, and that upon their going into my Lord's Room, he heard a very great trampling and buſtle, and my Lord cry out (Murder ſeveral times) as before depos'd; by this he ſhould have accuſed himſelf as privy to the Murder; for ſeeing <hi>Lloyd</hi> did not immediately cry out to the next Guard, ſo that theſe Ruffians might be ſecured, and if poſſible the Murder prevented, or at leaſt theſe Cut-throats taken, one of which he might eaſily have done. Nay, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility theſe Men would have ſoon deſiſted, had they heard the Sentinel cry out. But <hi>Lloyd</hi> lets them go, and inſtead of a Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, by Perjury endeavours to conceal it; and therefore may well be ſuppoſed prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to permit this execrable Tragedy.</p>

               <p>Two things are required of ſuch Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels; firſt, to ſee the Priſoner be kept cloſe, without any Communication by Word or Papers thrown into his Window; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to preſerve him from Violence.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41825:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>and diſcourſed (to the beſt of theſe Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mants remembrance, the ſaid <hi>R.</hi> declared it was) in French, concerning the Priſoners then in the <hi>Tower;</hi> and his <hi>Highneſs</hi> declared, That of all the Priſoners then there, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ought to be taken off: but his Majeſty ſaid he was reſolved to ſpare him for what his Father had ſuffer'd; upon which his Highneſs ſeemed very angry, and a little before the Death of the ſaid Earl, his Highneſs parted a little way from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and then two Men were ſent into the Earls Lodgings to murder him, which having done, the ſame two Men did again return to his Highneſs. <hi>This the ſaid</hi> R. <hi>declared with great Earneſtneſs and Paſſion, and proteſted he thought no Man was ſafe which was againſt the Popiſh Intereſt, if once they began thus bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced to cut Throats.</hi>

               <p>How very improbable is it, that the King and Duke ſhould talk ſo loud concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> as that a Souldier ſhould hear them? This ſeems to carry its own Confutation.</p>

               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>If you conſider it I think there is very little if any probability in this Evidence; for you may obſerve that <hi>R.</hi> declared the King and Duke ſtood a little way off from thoſe who attended them, and they diſcourſed in <hi>French.</hi> Now there is not one common Engliſh Souldier of a thouſand who doth underſtand <hi>French,</hi> the Odds was then ſo great that this Souldier knew not what they ſaid; therefore it's not ſo improbable as at firſt you may think it.</p>

               <p>Can it be thought that the Duke (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit he was ſo wicked as to be concerned in ſuch a Fact) would be ſo very fooliſh as to ſend the Ruffians ſo that any People might ſee their Miſſion and their Return.</p>

               <p>Pray conſider this Murder in all its Circumſtances, and then tell me whether thoſe bloody Varlets had not all Reaſon in the World to have all the Security could be expected or deſir'd; you well know that my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was deſervedly very popular, and therefore a Parliament that ſhould have had the leaſt Information of this treacherous and bloody Murder, would have proſecuted the Matter with all the Diligence and Vigor, that ſuch a piece of Barbarity deſerved. Now ſhould they in ſuch their Inquiſition have detected thoſe treacherous Villanes, theſe bloody Men muſt have expected no Mercy. And ſhould the Duke have imployed them in his Cloſet only, and they could not by any Circumſtance have given Satisfaction that they were his hired Journey-Men, in this piece of great Service, their Evidence againſt him had not been the tenth part ſo credible as it would have been, could they have proved that they were ſent by his Highneſs towards the Earl's Lodgings juſt before his Death, and ſoon after returned to his Highneſs, before others knew that this cruel Tragedy was finiſhed. This Circumſtance, I ſay, would have ſo corroborated their Evidence againſt their Maſter, that none could in the leaſt have doubted of the truth of their being ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, that were once ſatisfied they were as before ſent by, and returned to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This then obliged his Highneſs under no leſs Obligation than Self-Preſervation to skreen thoſe his faithful and ready Servants from any Proſecution, well knowing that his own Intereſt (and indeed Life) was wrapt up in theirs.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I think this matter was very cunningly managed (as to the Security of theſe Cut-throats from the Hands of Juſtice, either in their Puniſhment or Proſecution) and it could not poſſibly have been done with greater Safety to the Perſons of thoſe that did it.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41825:23"/>Morning, till after my Lord's Death. It's contradicted by the poſitive Oath of one, who ſwears, That he ſaw Major <hi>Hawley</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, a little before my Lord's Death, run up thro' that Gate which is nigh, and leads to his Houſe; and he would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly come in haſte down to the Gate, and peep on both ſides, as tho' he would ſee the way clear; and becauſe the Warder let in but one Man to the <hi>Tower, Hawley</hi> came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to him in great fury, chiding him for admitting that one.</q>

                  <q>It was ſo order'd by his Majeſty: for as ſoon as News of my Lord's Death was brought to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, then in the <hi>Tower,</hi> his Majeſty ſent my Lord <hi>Alling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Sir <hi>C</hi>— and <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> Eſq to my Lord's Lodgings, with Orders, That all who were attending upon my Lord at the time of his Death, ſhould be ſecured and examined, with relation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. His Majeſty did further order, That all things ſhould remain (as to the Body) in the ſame Circumſtances it was firſt found, till the Coroner's Inqueſt had ſeen the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.—Before Sir <hi>C</hi>— had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded far in the Examination of any about my Lord's Death, a Gentleman came (as from his Majeſty) with Orders, That Sir <hi>C</hi>— immediately ſhould go to the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> (where the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was then upon his Trial) and give the Attorny General notice of my Lord's Death: But Sir <hi>C</hi>— (by the ſame Gentleman) deſired his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to permit him to finiſh the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations (he was then upon) before he went; but the ſame Gentleman came the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, and declared, his Majeſty had expreſly ordered Sir <hi>C</hi>— to go forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and leave the Examinations to ſuch others as were there, (which Sir <hi>C</hi>— accordingly did). Sir <hi>C</hi>— further ſaith, That he remembers not who this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was, which thus twice came with Orders from his Majeſty.</q>

               <p>Forgot who this Gentleman was! this ſeems ſomewhat ſtrange, for within a Week after my Lord's Death, Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> appeared publick in the ſearch after it; and the very next Week after my Lord's Death, he was before the Council-Board, and this cauſed the Matter to be publickly diſcourſed; all the Circumſtances attending the Action, were uſed as Arguments of this Murder; not the leaſt whereof was the malicious and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41825:24"/>extravagant Application which the Court at the <hi>Old-Baily</hi> made againſt that Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Priſoner the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> then upon his Trial. Now Sir <hi>C</hi>— having been that Meſſenger that was ſent with the News of my Lord's Death, immediately ſaw, and could not but well obſerve, with what induſtrious Malice and Injuſtice Sir <hi>George Jefferies,</hi> and the then Attorny, applyed that ſad Accident to the taking off that brave, but unfortunate Perſon, whom they were then, by their ſtrained Conſtructions and Miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, villanouſly haranguing out of his Life. For this Reaſon Sir <hi>C</hi>— muſt immediately reflect upon his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meſſenger of ſuch ſad Tidings, and therein upon the Perſon that brought the Orders as from his Majeſty, for his ſuddain going to the <hi>Old-Baily;</hi> which Reflection would have ſo imprinted this Perſon in his Memory, that Sir <hi>C</hi>— were he not well known, would be thought to have had that happy Faculty of retaining, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting, at pleaſure.</p>

It's very poſſible Sir <hi>C.</hi> upon reflection may call to mind that Gentleman who brought thoſe Orders, and then, I dare ſay, he will, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that called upon, freely diſcover him, ſeeing by his ſilence, he would likewiſe by Perjury, conceal what might be of no ſmall uſe in this Detection.</p>

               <p>For my part I am well ſatisfied the Hand of treacherous <hi>Joab</hi> was in this Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and that the King's Name in this, as in other Things, was uſed by him, who not long after is thought to have removed both Name and Thing from him that then poſſeſſed them. But <hi>Bomeny, Monday,</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> ſhould have been immediatly ſeparated upon the firſt Diſcovery; and they ſhould have been kept apart till the Jury ſat; and the Jury ought to have examined theſe Men apart, and neither to have known what other had ſaid, ſeeing it was very natural to ſuppoſe, if my Lord fell by treacherous and violent Hands, theſe Men could not be ſtrangers to it; and therefore by their croſs Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons apart, they might the more eaſily be detected of Falſity; for ſeeing theſe Men were to give a falſe Relation of the Matter, (to hinder the diſcovery of the Truth) their ſeparate Examinations might the more eaſily have detected the Story, it being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult for three Men (upon ſeparate and croſs Examinations) ſo to agree, as to Time, Place, Perſon, Manner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of an Action as not to be detected; Truth is ſtill the ſame, but Lies are almoſt infinite.

                  <hi>J. W.</hi> Painter ſaith, That the very day the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> died, he went with one (<hi>George Jones</hi> ſince dead) to the <hi>Tower,</hi> to diſcourſe <hi>Nathaniel Monday</hi> concerning the Death of the ſaid Earl: and when they came to the <hi>Tower,</hi> meeting with the ſaid <hi>Monday,</hi> he gave them this Account; That as ſoon as the Gentleman Jaylor had opened my Lord's Chamber Door; that very morning, he the ſaid <hi>Monday</hi> (by Order) went in to my Lord's Chamber, and tarried there, becauſe their Orders were, that one of the Warders ſhould be in his Lordſhip's Chamber, and the other at the Stair's Foot. And that they had this farther Order, not to ſuffer his Lordſhip to have a Knife, or any thing like it, but whilſt he uſed it in cutting his Meat; and that being done, all Knives, and ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, were to be taken from him: To which his Lordſhip anſwered, He ſhould take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ill in them in obſerving their Orders. This Informant further ſaith, That the ſaid <hi>Monday</hi> did then declare, that he tarried with my Lord in his Chamber two hours, or better, that very morning; and that whilſt he was with my Lord in his Chamber, he did obſerve his Lordſhip paired his Nails with the Heel of a Razor. This Informant further ſaith, that the ſaid <hi>Monday</hi> did further declare, Before he left his Lordſhip, and went down Stairs to ſtand below, he called up <hi>Ruſſel</hi> his fellow-Warder, to ſtand in the Chamber; and as he went down Stairs, he lighted his Pipe and ſat at the Stairs foot; but before he had half ſmoaked his Pipe, he heard it cried above Stairs, that my Lord had cut his Throat. Hereupon he, the ſaid <hi>Monday,</hi> ran up Stairs; and puſhed the Cloſet Door open, and there found my Lord dead. This Informant further ſaith, that the ſaid <hi>Monday</hi> did further declare, That when he came up Stairs, he asked Mr. <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> where they were whilſt my Lord was in the Cloſet? The ſaid <hi>Bomeny</hi> anſwered, he was ſitting upon the Bed in my Lord's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and the ſaid <hi>Ruſſel</hi> declared, he ſtood at my Lord's Chamber Door, juſt without the Door: whereupon he, the ſaid <hi>Monday</hi> (as the ſaid <hi>Monday</hi> declared) check'd the ſaid <hi>Ruſſel</hi> for not keeping in the Chamber, according to Order. <hi>Richard Jordan</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, That on the day Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> was tried, (upon the account of the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>) this Informant heard <hi>Nath. Monday</hi> declare, That the very morning the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> died, as foon as the Gentlemen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> open'd the Chamber Door, which was about ſeven of the Clock, the ſaid <hi>Monday</hi> firſt ſtood as Warder above Stairs upon the ſaid Earl; and at the firſt opening the Door, did obſerve the ſaid Earl have a Razor in his Hand, pair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſcraping his Nails with it; and this the ſaid <hi>Monday</hi> declared he ſaw a long time before <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſtood Warder above Stairs upon the ſaid Earl.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>By theſe two Informations you may perceive what <hi>Monday</hi> declared, My Lord had this Razor in his Hand about ſeven a Clock in the Morning, long before <hi>Ruſſel</hi> came up Stairs to ſtand Warder upon my Lord; and that my Lord pared his Nails with the Heel of the Razor.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Monday</hi> I perceive tells <hi>W.</hi> the very day my Lord died, that the very ſame morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, about ſeven of the Clock, <hi>Monday</hi> told my Lord that they (his Warders) had Orders not to ſuffer his Lordſhip to have a Knife, or any thing like it, whilſt he was cutting his Meat; and that being done, the Knife was to be taken from his Lordſhip. This looks as tho there were ſome Jealouſies that my Lord would cut his Throat, for otherwiſe why would they not ſuffer him to have a Knife?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>It looks more like, either a Suggeſtion of <hi>Monday</hi>'s own Invention, or a Leſſon taught him to make others believe that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41825:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>there was ſuch a Suſpition: for <hi>Monday</hi> now denies it.</p>
               <p>I deſire now to compare theſe three Mens Relations, as to the Time of delivery of the Razor; by doing which, you will have reaſon to believe no Razor at all was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to his Lordſhip. For the clearer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding hereof, I ſuppoſe <hi>Bomeny</hi> under Examination with the Jury, and anſwering according to what he hath ſworn.</p>

               <p>I deſire that you will conſider when this Story was firſt told by the Boy <hi>(viz.)</hi> about ten of the Clock that morning my Lord died.
<note place="margin">☞</note> Now it was not then known it would be ſworn, that this Razor lay by my Lord's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, locked into the Cloſet when the Body was firſt found, as did appear the Monday af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when the Coroner's Inquiſition, and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meny</hi>'s Depoſition were printed; and therefore there could not be any uſe made of this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when firſt told, againſt the Truth of my Lord's (pretended) Self-murder, for that was poſſible to be true,
<note place="margin">☞</note> what was ſuggeſted in anſwer to this by a certain Gentleman, who as ſoon as he ſaw what <hi>Edwards</hi> declared, asked, What uſe could be made of it, and how this did appear to argue that my Lord was murdered? for he further ſaid, That it might be when <hi>Bomeny</hi> came and found that Razor, which he had before delivered to my Lord, proved the Inſtrument of his Death, he took it up, and with great indignation threw the Razor out of the Window, as we many times throw away what we have hurt our ſelves with. To this it was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, It appeared ſworn before the Coroner, That as ſoon as <hi>Bomeny</hi> ſaw my Lord, and part of the Razor, thro' a Chink of the Cloſet-Door, he called out to <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> that my Lord was fallen down Sick; ſo that there was a Noiſe of this in the Room before ever the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet Door was opened, and conſequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bomeny</hi> could have any opportunity to take up the Razor: Whereas it here appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by what <hi>Edwards</hi> ſaid, that all things were very quiet in the Houſe till the Maid had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up the Razor, and the Maid firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered my Lord's Death; Upon this the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman urged this no further, but what he herein declared was ſo ready at hand, as tho' he had before heard of the Razor's being thrown out, and thought this the beſt Salve for it. As for the pretence, that this Lie was invented to excuſe his truanting, this is very ridiculous; this Boy, in very great earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as ſoon as he returned from the <hi>Tower,</hi> told his Mother and Siſters, that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat, and thrown the Razor out of the Window; this argued his ſimplicity.</p>
               <p>Now the material part of the Story was then (generally believed to be) true, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Earl had cut his Throat, and that he ſhould add the throwing out of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor, when (as before obſerved) there could be no uſe thereof made towards the proof of my Lord's Murder, is ſuch a Suggeſtion as can't be ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>But as a clearer Anſwer to this, I will now tell you how the Boy came firſt to deny that he ſaw the Razor thrown out; and, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what made him forſwear it.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt; What occaſioned the Boy's firſt denial. When Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> went firſt to Mr. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Houſe, (which was <hi>Tueſday</hi> morning next after the Earl's Death) he asked Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> Whether his Son had ſeen a Bloody Razor thrown out of my Lord's Chamber-Window, juſt before the diſcovery of my Lord's Death? Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> at firſt was ſurpriſed with the Queſtion, and wept, ſaying, He was undone if he ſhould be turned out of his Place in the Cuſtom-Houſe; but being preſſed to ſpeak according to the Truth, he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what you have before heard; the like did the Mother, and two of the Siſters: Upon this Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> deſired to ſee the Boy, (for before this Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> never ſaw Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> or his Son, or any of his Family to his knowledg); the Father an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, He was gone to School; but if Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> would come in the Afternoon, the Boy ſhould be kept at Home, and he might then diſcourſe him, which Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to do.</p>
               <p>And accordingly about two of the Clock in the Afternoon went. When he came to Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> he was told by the Mother and Siſters, that the Boy had denied he ever ſaw any Razor thrown out. Upon which Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> inquired, Whether the Boy had ever deny'd it before he (the ſaid Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>) had been there that morning? To which it was anſwered, He had not. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> did further enquire, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41825:28"/>the Boy voluntarily deni'd it, or what made him do it? Upon which the Mother delared, That his Eldeſt Siſter (being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the Conſequence of this Story) as ſoon as the Boy that day came from the School, ran to him in great fury, and in a threatning manner told him, That ſeveral People would be hanged for what he had ſaid, and that he himſelf might be hang'd likewiſe. Upon which the Child came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to her, and cried out, The King would hang him; and immediately thereupon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied what he had before declared, and ſo often repeated, without any the leaſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
               <p>Hereupon Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> deſired the Boy might come into the Parlour, where, before his Relations, and others preſent, he might diſcourſe the Boy. At firſt the Child could not be perſwaded, being afraid; but at laſt came into the Room, where Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> before ſix or ſeven then preſent (none of which before that day he had, to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg ever ſeen) before ever he did ask the Boy, whether what he had as before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, were true or falſe, ſpoke to the Child to this Effect, <hi>(viz.) Mr. Braddon;</hi> Can you read? <hi>William Edwards;</hi> Yes. <hi>Mr. Braddon;</hi> Did you ever read the 5th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles? William Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;</hi> Yes. Don't you there find that there were two ſtruck dead upon the Place for telling a Lie. <hi>W. Edwards;</hi> Yes. <hi>Mr. Braddon;</hi> God is ſtill the ſame God of Truth, and a God of the ſame Power likewiſe; and he knowing all things, knows better than you your ſelf, whether what you declared were True or Falſe. Wherefore if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Lie, (notwithſtanding you have ſo often declared it to be true) now deny it, and never more own it, leſt for your ſaying that which is falſe, God execute the ſame Judgment upon you, and immediately ſtrike you dead: But if it be true, be neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid or aſhamed to own it. Immediately hereupon the Boy confeſſed it was true; and then declared as before related. Being asked, what made him deny it? he anſwered, His Eldeſt Siſter threatned him, and ſaid, the King would hang him; which the Siſter then likewiſe confeſſed.</p>
               <p>You have here a large Account how this Boy came firſt to deny it; and what was the Reaſon thereof; and likewiſe upon what Arguments he retracted his Denial, and ſtood to his firſt Confeſſion; all which will be fully proved by many Witneſſes, when the Matter comes under a Judicial Determination.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I am herein ſatisfied. But how came it to paſs that the Boy forſwore it at Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Trial?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>That is the ſecond thing to be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This Boy was ſubpoena'd on the behalf of the King, as well as by Mr. <hi>Braddon.</hi> And as <hi>William Edwards</hi> was going into <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall,</hi> that morning Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> was tried, and before he was ſworn, Major <hi>Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> (at whoſe Houſe my Lord died) meets him, and in a threatning manner told him, <q>That if he had the management of him, he would have him whip'd once a Fortnight on <hi>Monday</hi> morning, for ſeven Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for what he had ſaid.</q> This Child not being then above 13 Years of Age, was extreamly frighted with this Threat; and being ſo very young, was more ſenſible of the Pain of ſuch a Puniſhment, than of the Sacred Obligation of an Oath; and deni'd what was true, to avoid what he feared he might otherwiſe have ſuffered.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>It's very natural to ſuppoſe a Child of his Age might be frighted into a falſe Oath, being of ſuch Years, as he can't well be ſuppoſed to have that Notion of an Oath, which People of riper Years may and ought to have. But this argues Major <hi>Hawley</hi> to be a very ill Man, thus to threaten the Boy out of his Evidence.</p>

                  <hi>J.

               <p>That this Girl diſcovered this to her Aunt the very Morning my Lord died, proved by Mrs. <hi>G.</hi> and others are ready to atteſt the ſame. At Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Trial the Girl's Aunt, and one Mr. <hi>G.</hi> then a Lodger in her Aunt's Houſe, depoſed the ſame.</p>

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>You have here three Witneſſes ſworn, that this Child related this Story to her Aunt as ſoon as ſhe came from the <hi>Tower.</hi> Do you doubt the Truth of what theſe three Perſons have ſworn?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>I am very well ſatisfied theſe three depoſe the Truth; but it may be this Boy might tell the Girl what he ſaw, and ſo it is but one Evidence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>It will be proved as far as a Negative can be proved, That this Boy and Girl never ſpoke to each other till ſome time after the Earl's Death, and the Relations of the Boy and Girl were altogether ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to each other, having never (to their Remembrance) heard or ſeen one another, which might be well ſuppoſed, for their Habitation was ſome diſtance from each other: Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> and his Son and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly living in <hi>Mark-Lane,</hi> the Girl and her Relations at St. <hi>Katherines;</hi> beſides, you may obſerve the Girl ſtood upon the high Ground over againſt the Earl's Chamber Window, and the Boy in the lower Ground; where the Girl ſtood ſhe (being but ſhort) could hardly ſee the Ground where the Razor fell, but ſhe declared ſhe ſaw the Maid in the white Hood come thereupon out of Major <hi>Hawley</hi>'s Houſe: which Deſcription agreed exactly with that Deſcription the Boy gave of the Maid.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Their Evidence thus agreeing, can't well be doubted.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>I have been informed this Maid is now reputed of a looſe Character.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Admit it true, ſhe could not be ſo thought when ſhe was but juſt paſt twelve Years of Age, and it was then ſhe firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it, and ſix Years ſince and more ſwore it: Therefore her now Character can't in common Reaſon prejudice her then Teſtimony given in her innocent Chilhood, and her now Teſtimony is but a Repetition of her former Oath. Beſides, had this Fact been told by Perſons of never ſo great Infamy (that did appear to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſtrangers to each other) their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in their Relations had given Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to their Teſtimony,
<note place="margin">☜</note> being firſt repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when (as is before obſerved) there could be no end propoſed by telling this Lie, ſeeing when it was firſt declared, it appeared not in the leaſt inconſiſtent with the (pretended) Truth of my Lord's Self-Murder, becauſe this Razor after the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, out of Indignation, might have been thrown out of the Window by ſome attending on my Lord. Now had this been ſworn the next day after my Lord's Death, which at the time it was firſt told by this Boy and Girl, could not appear otherwiſe, then this Story of the Razor's being thrown out of my Lord's Chamber Window had fallen to the Ground, and no way uſeful to prove the Murder. But this I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready more at large inſiſted upon.</p>

               <p>It's an old and true Proverb, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Fools tell Truth; the Reaſon of this ſaying is, becauſe Children and Fools not being capable of that Invention, which ſuch as are of Years and Underſtanding may be ſuppoſed to have, ſpeak with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſign the naked Truth of the Fact.</p>

               <p>Theſe two Witneſſes agree with the Boy, not only in the Main (as you call it) but in ſeveral Circumſtances of the Story, with the Boy's Relation: Firſt, in the Main, that there was a bloody Razor thrown out of my Lord's Chamber-Window before his Death was known. Secondly, <hi>Meake</hi> agrees with the Boy, that the Boy did endeavour to take up this Razor, but was prevented by the Maid, who forthwith carried it into Major <hi>Hawley</hi>'s Houſe.

               <p>Yes, and ſaith, ſhe went out of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Houſe almoſt half an hour before my Lord's Death was known, and returned not until my Lord's Death was publick, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral People in the Houſe to ſee my Lord: For ſhe tells this Story, <q>That about half an hour before my Lord's Death was known, my Lord's Footman came to her, and told her, the Warder would not open the Wicket to let in my Lord's Proviſions that were brought; and therefore begged her to go to her Maſter, (Mr. <hi>Hawley,</hi> the Gentleman-Porter) to deſire him to go to the Warder that kept the Gate, and order him to let in the Proviſions.</q>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>It's much the Footman himſelf could not go to Major <hi>Hawley,</hi> for certainly the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor (well-knowing whoſe Footman he was) would ſoon go and give Orders to let in the Proviſions upon the Footman's requeſt as his Maids, unleſs the Maid had ſome collateral conſideration (beſides that of a Servant) which might influence her Maſter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>There was no need of eithers going, as you will immediately hear. Upon this ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <q>She did accordingly go to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who thereupon ordered the Warder to let in my Lord's Proviſions; and as they, <hi>(viz.)</hi> my Lord's Footman, <hi>Will. Turner,</hi> and one <hi>Sam. Peck,</hi> and a Porter, were bringing the Proviſions, a Sentinel told them, They were come too late; upon which this Maid declares ſhe was ſurpriſed, and asked <hi>Will. Turner</hi> what ſhould be the meaning of that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41825:31"/>Expreſſion, <hi>You are come too late;</hi> for ſhe did not underſtand it: Whereto <hi>Turner</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he did ſuppoſe the Sentinel believed thoſe Proviſions to be my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s, who being gone to his Trial, this Souldier might think he would never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and ſo the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were brought too late: This (ſhe declares) ſhe then believed; but as ſoon as they came in ſight of her Maſter's Houſe, they admired to ſee ſo great a Croud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Door, but were ſoon too well ſatisfied in the occaſion, for it was juſt before diſcovered that my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat.</q>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>This looks as a made Story: for, can it be thought that the Warder would not let in my Lord's Proviſions?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>It is indeed a forged Lye throughout; for <hi>William Turner, Samuel Peck,</hi> and the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do all three declare, that the Maid was not with them whilſt they were bringing in the Proviſions, neither did the Warder that kept the Gate in the leaſt ſcruple the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in my Lord's Proviſions; this they all ſay they are ready to depoſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Then this Maid is a Confederate; for otherwiſe ſhe would ſpeak the Truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Surely ſhe that endeavours by ſuch a falſe villanous Invention to evade the Truth, becomes conſenting to my Lord's Murder, and at the laſt day ſhall anſwer it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, ſhe may anſwer it before, if it be once plainly made appear that ſhe did carry up the Razor, and was the firſt that diſcovered my Lord's Death; for by what ſhe then ſaw, and hath ſince heard ſworn by thoſe who attended on my Lord, ſhe could not but be well ſatisfied my Lord was murdered, and endeavouring thus to ſtifle it by her falſe Evaſions—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>To which, ſhe ſaith, ſhe did ſwear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Secretary of State.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>That adds Perjury to the firſt Guilt. Without doubt her endeavouring by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to conceal and ſtifle the moſt perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and barbarous Murder our Nation ever knew, ſhall render her culpable in no ſmall degree.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Juſt as the Maid cried out, My Lord had cut his Throat, one Mr. <hi>B.</hi> (then an Enſign) ran into the Houſe, and was the firſt Man in my Lord's Chamber, after my Lord's Death was known, the Blood then ſeeming almoſt reeking hot; this Mr. <hi>B.</hi> declared, that as he ran in he did obſerve (this Maid whoſe Name he knew to be <hi>Alice</hi>) ſtanding at her Maſter's Door wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Hands and crying; and <hi>N.</hi> (who ſaw the Maid run into her Maſter's Houſe and up Stairs, and then heard her cry out, Murder, and likewiſe in her hand the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor) declares, that was the very Maid which ſtood at the Door when Mr. <hi>B.</hi> went into the Houſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>By all Circumſtances this muſt be the Maid; for had not this Wench been ſome way concerned, ſhe would never have invented this Lie; for Innocence flies not, nor needs a Lie for its Defence, but is always ſupported by Truth; and Innocence it ſelf becomes juſtly ſuſpected for Guilt when it makes uſe of a falſe Defence; the Law, and the natural Reaſon of the thing preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that every one will uſe the beſt, and conſequently the trueſt Defence in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of his Innocence. Pray proceed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>The Circumſtances of the Razor in the top's being ſo broken, and the many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notches, as before appears by the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor, are natural ſelf-Evidence of the Truth of the Razor's being thrown out of the Window; for my Lord in cutting his Throat could not ſo do it, notwithſtanding an old Chirurgion to the Jury declared otherwiſe; for the Jury asking him, Whether my Lord in cutting his own Throat could ſo break and notch the Razor? The Chirurgion an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that it was poſſible for my Lord to do it againſt his Neck-bone, occaſioned by the Tremefaction of my Lord's Hand when the Razor came to the Neck-bone.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Certainly there was a Tremefaction in the Chirurgion's Underſtanding or Honeſty, when upon Oath he gave this Anſwer, for I do ſuppoſe he was ſworn.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>He was ſo.—As a further Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt my Lord's cutting his Throat
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41825:31"/>in the Cloſet, the Circumſtances of the Cloſet (as found when my Lord was firſt found dead) appear in Evidence. You may obſerve the Cloſet is but three Foot and one Inch wide, and ſeven Foot long in one ſide, and about five Foot long in the other; now it's declared by thoſe attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on my Lord, that there was no Blood againſt the Wall a foot higher than the Floor, nor any upon the Clooſe-ſtool, or any of the Shelves of the Cloſet; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as had my Lord cut his Throat ſtanding on the Cloſet, the Blood would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately guſhed out of ſo large an Orifice five Foot at leaſt, wherefore that part of the Wall over againſt his Throat muſt have been very bloody; but in this caſe there was none at all, and therefore it could not be done ſtanding: neither did his Lordſhip do it kneeling; for there was no Blood as high as his Throat, as in that Poſture would have then been: and that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip did it not lying along, appears from the Poſition of the Razor; for the Wound beginning on the left ſide, and ending on the right, the Razor muſt have been on the right ſide of the Body, whereas it lay about fourteen Inches or more from the left.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>All theſe ſelf-Evidences might have appeared to the Jury upon their view; and it's very much they did not obſerve them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>What the Jury did, and how they were managed, you ſhall ſoon hear. But I ſhall,</p>
               <p>Firſt, take notice of the many Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities, with reſpect to the Management of my Lord's Body, the Chamber and Cloſet after my Lord's Death.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The falſe and malicious Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions by Major <hi>Hawley</hi> to the Jury, to hinder the Diſcovery of the Truth, and to influence them to the belief of my Lord's ſelf-Murder: And,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Oppreſſions, Threats and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities ſince uſed to avoid a Detection of this unparalled bloody Treachery.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Irregularities with relation to the Body, Room and Cloſet after my Lord's Death, theſe were ſuch as prevented the Jury from making thoſe Obſervations you ſay were natural for them to obſerve; for the Body was ſtripp'd and waſhed, and the Clothes carried away, and likewiſe the Chamber and the Cloſet waſhed, before ever the Jury ſaw the Body; and when the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the next day ſaw the Body, my Lord lay ſtripp'd and waſhed in the Chamber, and covered with a Sheet.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>This was very irregular, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all Practices, when a Body is found dead, eſpecially under the ſuſpicion of ſelf-Murder, I ſay, under a bare ſuſpicion; for ſeeing none could be examin'd in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to give any Account how my Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came dead, but thoſe immediately atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on my Lord, and ſuch being ſtrongly to be ſuſpected as privy to the Murder (if my Lord were by others treacherouſly taken off) the Body, and all things with relation to it, ſhould have remained under the Circumſtances firſt found in, and the Perſons thus attending on my Lord ſecured apart, in order to their Examination; ſo that they might not inſtruct each other, and agree in a feigned Story to avoid the Diſcovery of their moſt perfidious Villany.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>This had been indeed natural, and according to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's expreſs Order; but contrary to both, the matter was managed, according as you have heard declared.</p>
               <p>The next day after my Lord's Death the Jury met, and viewed the Body at Major <hi>Hawley</hi>'s Houſe, under the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances before related; and then the Jury were adjourned to a Victualling Houſe in the <hi>Tower</hi> to conſider of their Inquiſition. When the Jury had the Matter thus under Examination, Mr. <hi>Fiſher</hi> (one of the Jury) demanded a ſight of the Cloathes: upon which the Coroner was called into the next Room, and returning in ſome heat ſaid, It was the Body, and not the Cloaths
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41825:32"/>they were to ſit upon; the Body was there, and that was ſufficient.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Who was it that called the Coroner into the next Room? and to whom did he there go? for it's probable this was what theſe Gentlemen (who ever they were) then in the next Room, would not have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into ſo ſtrictly; I deſire to know their Names.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>The Coroner proteſts he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got who called him, or to whom he there went.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Forgot! I muſt confeſs I have heard of the Art of Memory, but never of the Art of Forgetfulneſs: as none are ſo deaf as thoſe that will not hear, ſo none ſo forgetful as thoſe that will not remember.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>You are very ſharp upon the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, of whom I have a more charitable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Your Charity ought not to blind your Judgment; Can you believe this Gentleman forgets, what he hath had all the reaſon i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable to remember? for ſeeing my Lord's Death was ſo ſoon after his Death queſtioned, this muſt naturally put the Coroner upon reflecting on what paſſed, which might argue either for or againſt the Murder. I am ſure theſe Reflections would have naturally brought to, and imprinted in his Mind this particular Paſſage: but, peradventure, ſhould the Coroner true Anſwer make to this Point, and confeſs that ſuch Gentlemen in the next Room adviſed him to check the Jury for their too great Inquiſitives, this would have look'd like making himſelf an Acceſſory (<hi>in Fore Conſcientiae</hi> at leaſt) after the Fact; and therefore ſelf-preſervation makes him forget what otherwiſe he might well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt confeſs you have ſome Reaſon on your ſide; but ſeeing the Coroner is fair in his Anſwers to other Queſtions, and hath, (by his ingenuity in diſcovering what we could not have otherwiſe known) been aſſiſting to a Detection; I do from ſuch his fairneſs and readineſs argue for his Innocence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>He is fair, I find, in his Anſwers to ſuch Queſtions as touch not himſelf, but when Self lies at ſtake, he prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>It's very probable he may at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent forget what hereafter may come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Mind; and I dare ſay he will be ingenuous in what he knows when his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſerves, for I have heard a very fair Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Gentleman.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>When his Memory doth ſerve (as you call it) I ſhall believe his Forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be real, but till then pardon me if I think otherwiſe.</p>

               <p>From what Circumſtances of the Cloaths could the Jury have had any ſight into the Matter?</p>

               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Had the Body lain in its firſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, the Jury would have ſeen the print of a bloody Foot on my Lord's Stocking, coming out of the Cloſet, which would have argued, that ſome had before been with the Body in the Cloſet, though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary was then pretended by thoſe three at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on my Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They would have found my Lord's Cravat cut in three pieces, as the two Women that ſtrip'd my Lord have often declared, proved, as followeth, <hi>(viz.)</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>It's very much my Lord had not put off the Cravat, or cut above it, had he done it himſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Thoſe that attended on my Lord, ſay, my Lord had put off his Periwig, and laid it upon the Shelf of the Cloſet, that the Hairs of the Periwig might not hinder the Action.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Sure the Neck of the Cravat was a far greater Impediment, and ſuch as would have effectually hindred my Lord from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with a Razor, the pretended Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Death.

And this Informant was then further informed, That the ſaid <hi>Holland</hi> had further declared to the ſaid <hi>D.</hi> that ſome People were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made away for blabbing what they knew concerning the ſaid Earl's Death, and that the ſaid <hi>D.</hi> had charged the ſaid Mr. <hi>Holland,</hi> before ſeveral of their Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, one day drinking together, with what the ſaid <hi>Holland</hi> had confeſſed to him the ſaid <hi>D.</hi> as aforeſaid; and that he the ſaid <hi>Holland,</hi> upon his being ſo charged, ſeemed much dejected, but could not deny it. This Informant further maketh Oath, That one <hi>D.P.</hi> about three Years ſince, did give this Informant almoſt the ſame Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, with relation to <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> And the ſaid <hi>D.P.</hi> did further tell this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, that when the ſaid <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> were committed to <hi>Newgate</hi> for Robbing Mr. <hi>Gatford,</hi> the ſaid <hi>D. P.</hi> went to ſee the ſaid <hi>Holland</hi> in <hi>Newgate,</hi> to condole his Condition: But the ſaid <hi>Holland</hi> was very cheerful, and told him, the ſaid <hi>D. P.</hi> he was
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41825:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſecure of his Life, and likewiſe not to want Mony as long as the Earl of <hi>Sunderland</hi> was living. The ſaid <hi>D. P.</hi> did likewiſe then further tell this Informant,—That the ſaid <hi>Holland</hi> (as ſoon as he was committed to <hi>Newgate</hi> for the aforeſaid Robbery) ſent to my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> for ſome Mony, and that his Lordſhip ſent him the ſaid <hi>Holland,</hi> 16 <hi>Guineas.</hi> And this Informant hath been told by ſeveral, that the ſaid Lord <hi>Sunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hath many times ſupplied the ſaid <hi>Holland</hi> with Mony.</p>

               <p>I have been credibly informed, by a Gentleman that was once a fellow-Priſoner in the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> with <hi>Holland,</hi> that <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> did uſe to bring Letters he writ to my Lord <hi>Sunderland,</hi> and deſired this Gentleman to direct them in French, pretending, that if my Lord ſaw his hand, he would not open the Letter.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>I rather believe the Direction was to cheat my Lord's Servant (who carried the Letter from the Meſſenger, or Penny-poſt Man) than to influence my Lord to read it.</p>

               <p>This looks moſt likely, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, this <hi>W.</hi> his (once about three Years ſince) ſaying to <hi>Holland,</hi> it was much whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, that my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> did not cut his own Throat, but was by others taken off; <hi>Holland</hi> ſaid, Damn him,

               <p>I have heard of a Letter writ by <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> (if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not); which Letter was read in the Houſe of Lords, and therein it was ſaid, that Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> would have ſuborned <hi>Holland</hi> to ſwear in this Caſe; and as I have heard, Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> offered a confiderable Reward to Mrs. <hi>Holland,</hi> and a Friend of <hi>Holland</hi>'s, to prevail with <hi>Holland</hi> to come in, and take upon him this villanous Crime. This, if true, was a very foul practice.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, if true, it had been villanous, and had deſerved (before God) as great Puniſhment as the Murderers themſelves: For as in the Old Law, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 19.16, &amp;c.) <q>If any falſe Witneſs riſe up againſt his Neighbour, the Perſon forſworn (when detected to be ſo) was to receive the ſame Puniſhment the Man accuſed ſhould have undergone, in caſe the Charge had been true; whether Tooth for Tooth, or Life for Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> This Law hath an innate uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Reaſon; and it were not amiſs if the ſame were with us enacted. Now as the Witneſs himſelf doth deſerve this Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the like <hi>(in Foro Conſcientiae)</hi> doth the Suborner: For if in our Law, he that hireth another to poiſon, ſtab, or any other ways to murder a Man, is juſtly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed Acceſſory before the Fact, and ſhall undergo the ſame Capital Puniſhment, the Principal ſhall ſuffer: So do I think it reaſonable that whoſoever ſuborns a Perſon, to take away the Life of any, is (before God) guilty of the Murder of the Perſon accuſed, equally with him that commits the Perjury; and both are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, according to the univerſal Reaſon of the Thing, guilty of a more heinous Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, than he that cuts another's Throat; ſeeing in this he corrupts Juſtice, and by Perjury makes Juſtice (which by God is deſigned, and by Man uſed as a protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Innocent) a Means to deſtroy, whom in its own Nature it ſhould acquit and protect. If that Phyſician, who to deſtroy his Patient, maliciouſly poiſons his Phyſick, (deſigned by Nature for the preſervation of the natural Man) deſerves the worſt ſort of Death, becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo vilely treacherous; how much more heinouſly criminal is he, who by Subornation or Perjury, corrupts Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which Heaven enacted, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind flies to for a Security to the Moral Man. Wherefore with you I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in this Particular, that Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> deſerves the worſt Death could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, were he guilty of this (indeed Falſe and Malicious) Charge. But the truth of the Caſe, I can in great part at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, which is this, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> having ſome reaſon to believe <hi>Holland</hi> one of the Ruffians, he did uſe all means poſſible for his Apprehenſion; but he found that <hi>Holland</hi> lay very private; and, as he had reaſon to believe, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fly beyond-Seas, (as his own Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before-mentioned declared); hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> applied himſelf to ſome of <hi>Holland</hi>'s Acquaintance, and by them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to Mrs. <hi>Holland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> told her, That he had reaſon to believe her Husband was concerned in this vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous Murder; and herein he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Mr. <hi>Holland</hi>'s abſconding; for Innocence deſires a Trial, but Guilt ſtill flies from Juſtice. Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> then told her, That if her Husband were really guilty of this Fact, and would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſurrender himſelf, ingenuouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring how, by whom, and with whom, and for what hired to do this barbarous Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, her Husband would have a general Pardon, and both him and her provided
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41825:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>for. But if her Husband was innocent, (nothwithſtanding whatſoever was ſaid to the contrary) and ſhould take upon him a Crime (for any advantage whatſoever) of which he was not guilty, he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be hanged here, and damned hereafter, ſeeing by his Perjury he would make Juſtice an Inſtrument of executing the worſt of Murders.— But if he were indeed the Man, and ſhould ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf, and diſcover the whole matter, he muſt be ſure to keep within the limits of Truth; for ſhould he be detected in the leaſt Perjury, no Man was more vigorouſly proſecuted, nor any more ſeverely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than he (for ſuch his Perjury) muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the Arguments with which Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> would have ſuborned (as that Letter calls it) <hi>Holland</hi> to a full Diſcovery: and I do appeal to all the World, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, admitting this to be true (as it will be proved when occaſion ſerves) Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> deſerves this Villanous Charge; for the Truth of this I do (on Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s behalf) appeal to the Conſciences of Mrs. <hi>H.</hi> Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and Mr. <hi>S.</hi> with whom Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> ſeveral times treated in this Affair.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>If the Caſe were as you have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it, Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> did nothing herein but what was conſiſtent with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and for which he deſerves not the leaſt Cenſure. If I miſtake not, you ſaid <hi>Holland</hi> did alſo go to others for a Supply, as well as my Lord <hi>Sunderland;</hi> Pray who were theſe?</p>

               <p>But to return to the Jury from whence we digreſſed in purſuit of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Inſtrument of Death.</p>
               <p>And to the ſecond Particular, <hi>viz. Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s unfair Practice, with relation to the Jury, to corrupt them into a belief of the (pretended) ſelf-Murder.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Fiſher</hi> did then further declare, that he had been informed my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was a very pious good Gentleman: to which <hi>Bomeny</hi> anſwered, My Lord was indeed a very pious good Man; upon which <hi>Fiſher</hi> reply'd, it was then very improbable he ſhould be guilty of this the worſt of Actions.</p>
               <p>Major <hi>Hawley</hi> perceiving that the Jury were like to be infiuenced with my Lord's true Character (for ſuch indeed his Lordſhip was, as he was to <hi>Fiſher</hi> repreſented) and thereby made believe that my Lord did not cut his one Throat; (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to what Major <hi>Hawley</hi> may be reaſonably preſumed to deſire they ſhould find) therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this, and corrupt them into a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41825:34"/>of a Lie, <hi>viz.</hi> The pretended ſelf-Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; <hi>Hawley</hi> tells <hi>Fiſher</hi> that it was his Miſtake in my Lord, that made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Lordſhip ſuch a Man; for all thoſe that knew his Lordſhip well,
<note place="margin">☞</note> knew this of him, That it was a fix'd Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in my Lord, that any Man might cut his own Throat, or otherwiſe diſpoſe of his Life, to avoid a diſhonourable and infamous Death: ſo that this Action was not unlike his Lordſhip, but according to his avow'd and fix'd Principles. This falſe and malicious Suggeſtion of Major <hi>Hawley</hi> (which the Jury then did ſuppoſe to be true) did very eaſily incline them to believe that my Lord had (purſuant to this Principle) cut his own Throat, to avoid that Diſhonourable and Infamous Death, which his Circumſtances ſeem'd to threaten.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>What is this <hi>Hawley?</hi> Could his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition pretend to any Intimacy with his Lordſhip, that he ſeemed ſo well to know my Lord's Principles in this matter?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hawley</hi> now denies all, and proteſts to their Lordſhips of this Committee, that he was not nigh the Jury in the Victualling-Houſe all the time of their Inquiſition, nor ever heard it ſaid to be my Lord's Principle, That any Man might cut his Throat to avoid an Infamous Death, till their Lordſhips in this Committee told him ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Sure the Major's Memory muſt be very ſhort, for there is hardly any Man of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in Town, but muſt have often heard it ſo ſaid, it being a general diſcourſe, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon my Lord's Death, that ſuch was his Lordſhip's Principle.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>This I have been very often credibly informed, and have heard it reported in all Coffee-houſes, and uſed as one, and not the leaſt Argument of my Lord's having indeed cut his own Throat. I do much wonder the Major ſhould pretend that he never heard of it, eſpecially when he himſelf did ſuggeſt the ſame to the Jury, and preſs'd it as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Lord's Self-Murder; I do not well underſtand this.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Gentlemen, to me the reaſon of this is plain; For when Major <hi>Hawley</hi> found that ſuch a Suggeſtion was uſed as an Argument of his Guilt, to avoid this Charge, he doth not only deny his ſuggeſting it, but, as a good Reaſon (had it been true) that he could not, declared, he never heard it by any ſaid (before their Lordſhips charged him with it) that ſuch was my Lord's Principle.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Major <hi>Hawley</hi>'s denying that he did ſuggeſt this to the Jury, or ever heard it ſaid to be my Lord's Principle, when the Matter is poſitively ſworn againſt him,
<note place="margin">☜</note> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally argues that this was a falſe, forged, and malitiouſly-invented Story, by that bloody Party; and <hi>Hawley</hi> the Man by them pitched upon, as the moſt proper Perſon to corrupt the Jury, (the then proper legal Judges of the Manner of my Lord's Death) with this treacherous and villanous contrived Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo that the Jury might be more eaſily inclined to believe my Lord's Self-Murder upon evidence as inconſiſtent as falſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>I do much admire Major <hi>Hawley</hi> ſhould deny he was with the Jury at the Victualling-houſe, if he were indeed there; ſeeing his being with them there was no Crime, and therefore needed no denial.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>His bare being there, needed neither denial or excuſe; but to avoid the Charge of what he falſely and treacherouſly did whilſt he was there (which he could never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe) he thought beſt, in general, to deny that he was with the Jury at all in the Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alling-houſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>But this was very Fooliſh, becauſe the Major being ſo well known, (and it may be to all the Jury) his being there could not but be remembred by many of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Almoſt all the Jury do remember him there, and likewiſe the Coroner, and Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can't but know he was there.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>The Major's denial therefore looks ill: for if he had been there, upon any lawful or indifferent Account, he might have lawfully and innocently juſtified the ſame; but his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial (when proved ſo very falſe) looks as though his Charge were too true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>The Jury had another Reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Major's being there with them
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41825:35"/>at the Victualling-houſe; for when ſome of the Jury moved for the Adjournment of their Inquſition till ſome further time, and in the Mean while notice to be given to my Lord's Honourable Relations, that they might bring what Evidence they thought good.—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>This had been proper, and it's very cuſtomary; for ſometimes the Jury do not bring in their Inquiſition in many days.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>It had been both proper and practiſed in this Caſe, had not Major <hi>Hawley</hi> preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it.</p>

                  <hi>Hawley</hi> enters a <hi>Caveat</hi> by another vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous and falſe Suggeſtion:
<note place="margin">☞</note> for upon this Motion of the Jury, <hi>Hawley,</hi> with great earneſtneſs, aſſures the Jury, they could not adjourn their Inquiry, but muſt immediately diſpatch; becauſe his Majeſty (<hi>Charles</hi> the Second) had ſent an Expreſs for their Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and would not riſe from Council (where he was then ſitting) till their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry was brought him; wherefore they muſt make all haſte poſſible. This the Jury believing, they made more haſte than good ſpeed, and ſo, ſooner than otherwiſe they would, finiſh'd their Inquiſition.</p>

               <p>The Men of our <hi>late Loyalty</hi> will ſpeak the better of him upon this very account, and that which would make him odious in the ſight of honeſt Men, in the eſteem of theſe renders him the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable; but as for theſe worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who have had good Thoughts of this Man, as ſoon as they find theſe things, (and ſomewhat elſe) ſworn againſt him, they muſt either believe him not Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in this, or diſcredit the Evidence; to do which, would argue Prejudice, when the Accuſer is of a clearer Reputation than ever this Gentleman can pretend to; and beſides, in this ſtands <hi>Rectus in Curia,</hi> neither his Perſon or Eſtate depending upon the Iſſue of this Cauſe; nay, if he ſtand under any Prejudice, it is, that my Lord ſhould ſtill appear a Self-murderer, becauſe, ſhould it prove otherwiſe, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner's Inqueſt (of which this Gentleman is one) muſt expect the laſh of ſome Mens Tongues; though I do think them to blame in nothing but ſome indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for I am verily perſwaded, that theſe Gentlemen (for the moſt part, at leaſt) did not rejoice in that unfortunate Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but did heartily wiſh they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any Information to find it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than their Evidence moved them to; but nothing of that appearing from any Perſons who came in to depoſe on my Lord's behalf, and theſe Gentlemen being obliged to go according to <hi>Evidence,</hi> they are not ſo much to be blamed, as pitied, for being ſo hurried into their Inqueſt.</p>

               <p>You ſay the Jury ought to have proceeded according to <hi>Evidence:</hi> Ought they not under that Notion to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the ſeveral Irregularites in the total Change of the Circumſtances of the Body, Room, and Cloſet, from the State in which they were when the Body was firſt found? Ought they not to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, as <hi>Evidence,</hi> the palpable and groſs Contradictions, (before at large obſerved,) between thoſe attending on my Lord, which argued the Falſity of the Evidence, and that, the truth of my Lord's being murdered? And ought they not to have conſidered, as <hi>Evidence,</hi> the ſeveral Cuts before obſerved to be in my Lord's Right-hand, which argued his Reſiſtance to put off the Inſtrument of Death? Ought they not to have conſidered as, <hi>Evidence,</hi> the Gentlemens tampering with the Coroner in the next Room (for I can believe theſe Gentlemen there for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) and 'till the Coroner's Memory ſerves him to name theſe Men, and their Buſineſs with him, I ſhall not think the beſt of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41825:36"/>him: Beſides all which, they ought to have conſidered, as <hi>Evidence,</hi> the Circumſtances of the Razor, the (pretended) Inſtrument of Death, and compared the length of the Razor with the depth of the Wound, and they would not have found an Inch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Now the Razor, as appears by your deſcription, being a <hi>French</hi> Razor, and not having any Tongue or Spill, this Razor, in the uſe by my Lord, could be held by nothing but the very Blade, and not leſs than two Inches of that muſt be held in my Lord's Hand, to cut with that ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtrength the making this large and deep Wound required; ſo that the Jury would then have found not above two Inches without the Hand to make a Wound above three Inches deep: this muſt have appeared ſuch a Mathematical Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, as would have been compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by all, and of it ſelf had been ſufficient to have proved the (pretended) ſelf-Murder a Forgery. To all which, to clear the Jury from all Blame, let us add their not examining thoſe three attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on my Lord apart, but ſuffering them to know one anothers Examinations, ſo that they might agree in their Story; and the better to help them herein, to permit my Lord's Servant when he began to falter in his Relation (which alone gave ſuſpicion enough, that he was telling a Lie, for Truth would have readily occurr'd) to go into the next Room (to his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors without doubt) and write his own Information; and yet after all, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were incoherent and contradictory. Theſe your honeſt Jury-Men have in all this gone according to <hi>Evidence,</hi> have they not? Do they deny that they obſerved theſe things? if they did not, it argues either their great Simplitity, or ſomewhat much worſe.</p>

               <p>Some of theſe they do confeſs to have obſerved, but others they diſown to have taken any notice of; in particular (they ſay) they remember not to have obſerved any Cuts in my Lord's Right-hand.</p>

               <p>And therefore this Gentleman was reſolved to forget, to reflect upon them! I perceive this Gentleman doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how his ſtifling (in not owning what he can't but remember) the Truth makes him, <hi>in Foro Conſcientiae,</hi> acceſſory after the Fact, to my Lord's Murder: For whoſoever there is that knows any thing, which he believes in its Diſcovery might tend to the Detection of this moſt perfidious Murder, and by his Silence endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſtifle it, therein (before God) becomes conſenting to that Fact, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory to which at the laſt day he ſhall anſwer. Our Law makes him acceſſory after the Fact, that endeavours to conceal and convey any from Juſtice, whom he knows guilty of ſuch a Villany; and for ſuch his Crime he ſhall anſwer with the Forfeiture of his Life. Now the reaſon of this Law I take to be this; becauſe ſuch an Offender (endeavouring to defraud Juſtice of its due, by protecting his Life, which by his Tranſgreſſion became forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Law) becomes conſenting to the Fact, and ſhall in his own Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſubjected to that Puniſhment, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by him ſo conveyed away would have ſuffered, when taken; nay, the Crime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not excuſed by the Perſon's being apprehended, after he is ſo concealed or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed away, but the Perſon guilty hereof ſhall ſuffer the ſame Capital Puniſhment that is inflicted upon the Principal.</p>

               <p>And this brings me to the laſt general Conſideration, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Backwardneſs of the then Government, and the many Threats, great Oppreſſion, and barbarous Cruelty that hath been uſed to prevent a Diſcovery of thoſe barbarous and bloody-minded Men, with other Particulars, which ſeem to argue my Lord's being villanouſly murdered.</p>

When Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> went to the Earl of <hi>Sunderland,</hi> then Secretary of State, the very next <hi>Thurſday</hi> after the Death of the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him the Information of <hi>William Edwards</hi> and his Mother, (ready writ, but not ſworn) my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> ſeemed much ſurpriſed upon reading of them, (and indeed he had reaſon to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, if he ſtands ſo related to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as he is now ſuſpected to be); and then, in ſome heat, asked Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> Who bad him bring thoſe Things to him?
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41825:37"/>To which it was anſwered, That Sir <hi>Henry Capel</hi> had deſired it. Upon which my Lord ordered Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> to come the next morning, and bring the Parties concerned, ſaying, <hi>If it were proper, he would take them.</hi>

               <p>If it <hi>were proper,</hi> my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> would take them! Certainly the Inquiry after a Murder is <hi>proper</hi> for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy; and the Murder of a Perſon of ſo great Quality, a <hi>State-Priſoner</hi> in the <hi>State-Priſon,</hi> by virtue of a Secretary of <hi>State's</hi> Warrant, is <hi>proper</hi> for a Secretary of State to inquire into, eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Relation that this Murder might be ſuppoſed to bear towards Perſons not of the leaſt Quality, nor Matters of the meaneſt Conſideration.</p>

               <p>As there hath been heretofore a great Difference between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo have we lately ſeen the day when the Crown and the Crowned Head have been Diametrically oppoſite. The Crown [the legal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive I mean] could do no wrong, but the Head that wore it hath done a World of miſchief. The Judges did not obey the Crown [the Rightful Sovereignty] when they illegally deſtroyed Charters; nor were thoſe vile Varlets that ſuborned Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, truly Loyal; or thoſe Mercenary Judges, Council and Jury, who (in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to their own Conſciences) ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to believe thoſe State-hired-Hackney-thorough-paced-perjured-Caitifs, who judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially murdered Men: 'Twas not the Crown, but he who poſſeſſed it, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced with all Law by an unjuſt uſurp'd Prerogative, the Peoples Rights being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed from them, and ſold to <hi>James</hi> the Second by the Corruption of that Bench, who (as an Honourable Brave Engliſh-Liberty-Property-Martyr truly ſaid) had before been Scandals to the Bar. It was not the Crown, but the Crowned Head, that by an Illegal Arbitrary Power (and not Authority) ſent thoſe worthy brave true Engliſh Spirits, the moſt Reverend his Grace, and the Right Reverend the other Six Biſhops, to the Tower, for humbly offering their Reaſons for their Non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with what in Conſequence would have levelled all Fences to Property, Liberty and Life, neither of which (had that power in its largeſt Extent been compli'd with) could we have poſſeſſed but by ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious Right as a Royal Arbitrary <hi>Ipſe Dixit</hi> at all times would have bar'd; and had not the Crown [the uncorrupt Regal Authority] as truly ſtated by thoſe Learned Councils in this Eminent Tryal, acquitted theſe ever-to-be remembered Pillars from any Violation of Reflection upon its Juſt Rights, the Head that wore it would ſoon <hi>Gradatim</hi> have rob'd thoſe Noble Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Church and State Confeſſors of their high Characters, Liberties, Priviledges and Immunities, whether Eccleſiaſtical or Civil (for I believe an Impriſoned Biſhop under Conviction and Judgment, and no Biſhop, is no farther diſtant than a King's Priſon and Grave) and therein ingratefully ruined the Chief of that Church, which (through their too great Charity for his Perſon) had not only ſecured the Crown to him in Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, (when others whoſe Charity blinded not their Judgments, would have prudently forecloſed his Title) but likewiſe in 1685. fixed and ſettled it, when threatned with that ſtorn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which none but ſuch (thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully requited) could have diverted. In this the common Proverb was verified, <hi>Periet quod facies Ingrato:</hi> Or, Save a, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>That was one reaſon that he proceeded, but it was not the reaſon which firſt engaged him; and therefore in anſwer to this, Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> told that Honourable Board, That he was altogether unrelated to, and unobliged by that Honourable Family, ſo that there lay no more perſonal engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in him firſt to move, than upon any Man whatſoever, (who might meet with the ſame Information.) He declared it was his love to Truth and Juſtice, that therein firſt moved him; and as he was a Chriſtian, he thought himſelf bound in duty to do what he had done, and (through the Grace of God) his Duty therein he would do, though Death ſtared him in the Face every ſtep he made.</p>

               <p>Truly I think His Highneſs might be the leaſt Stranger to what theſe men had Sworn; for from what I have heard, I do believe that the ſame Power and Intereſt that hired thoſe perfidious Villains to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit what was ſo barbarouſly executed, had likewiſe given them Inſtructions what to Swear, to give colour to the pretended Self-murder, and therefore His Highneſs might be the beſt prepared to anſwer all Objections againſt theſe mens Depoſitions.

               <p>His Highneſs could not then turn Reconciler, and therefore ſaid nothing to this matter, but delivered them to his then Majeſty, who ſaid as little; whereupon the then Lord Keeper <hi>North</hi> took thoſe Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and endeavoured to reconcile what was indeed irreconcileable: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Mr. Braddon</hi> objected againſt his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Reconciliation, and urged the former Objections further; upon which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſeemed (though not much by his words, yet by his very pale changed Countenance) highly diſpleaſed with <hi>Mr. Braddon</hi> for making thoſe Reflections.</p>

               <p>What were theſe Depoſitions Printed for, but to be obſerved? did his Lordſhip think that every man would ſwallow ſuch groſs Contradictions as his Lordſhip's Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption (againſt his Judgment) would have reconciled?</p>

               <p>After a long Examination, too tedious here to repeat, <hi>Mr. Braddon</hi> was ordered to withdraw; and then the Young <hi>William Edwards</hi> was called in, the Child (being then not Thirteen years of Age) was very much afraid (having, as before, been fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly frighted by his Eldeſt Siſter, as though the King would Hang him) and cry'd; whereupon (as the Siſter hath reported) the Child was ſtroaked upon the Head, and bid not to cry, and then asked, Whether he had not invented that Lye, to excuſe his Truenting that day?</p>

               <p>You are in the right, for the Child to this queſtion anſwered, Yes: The Siſter was examined, and ſhe gave the ſame account you have before at large heard, as to what the Boy had declared, and how <hi>Mr. Braddon</hi> had diſcourſed them; and then <hi>Mr. Braddon</hi> was the ſecond time called in, and by the Lord Keeper <hi>North</hi> told, that he had inſtructed this Boy in a Lye, and would have ſuborned the Child to Swear it. To which Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> anſwered, It was impoſſible he could inſtruct him to ſay what the Boy had declared ſeveral days before he had ever ſeen the Boy or any of his Relations, as appeared by what his Siſter and the Boy himſelf muſt own.</p>

               <p>Had not his Lordſhip's Honour and Intereſt ſuborned his Conſcience in this matter, he would have dealt more fairly.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bradden</hi> then told his Lordſhip, That being well ſatisfied in his Innocence and Integrity, he ſeared not any Proſecution, but would readily give whatſoever Bail his Lordſhip ſhould require; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Afternoon gave Bonds with two Friends in 2000 <hi>l.</hi> a piece for his Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and hereupon continued the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution with all Vigor imaginable, for he was now obliged in Self-Juſtice to endeavor in what he could, to corroborate the Boy's Evidence, which my Lord Keeper <hi>North</hi> corruptly called a Lye, and to which his Lordſhip (without any ground) pretended that Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> would have ſuborned the Boy to Swear; for at the ſame time it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to his Lordſhip, as far as Negative could appear, that Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> had not

               <p>It is very natural for men to be deter'd from engaging in that which was ſo roughly managed by the Council-Board, and threatned the Ruine of him who firſt appeared; for few men are for living a State-Confeſſor caged up within Iron Grates, or dying their Countries Martyr, but think themſelves obliged to mind only their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Affairs, leaving all Affairs of State to thoſe that have the Command and Steerage of this great Veſſel [the Government] leſt by their Intermeddling in thoſe tickliſh matters, themſelves ſhould have followed the unjuſt misfortune of thoſe brave men, who couragiouſly, though to their Ruine, oppoſed themſelves to the uſurpt Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative and Tyranny of the Times.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> told the Juſtice, the Warrant was illegal; for ſhould the Goaler never hear from the King and Council, he muſt be kept a perpetual Priſoner: Warrants of Committment ought to conclude, <hi>Till he be diſcharged by due Courſe of Law.</hi> But the Juſtice having Mr. <hi>Beach</hi> and ſome Attorneys of his own Judgment, declared he would juſtifie the Warrant; and under this Warrant Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> lay in <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> Goal about a Fortnight, and was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> upon the Statute to be bailed. All the Judges being out of Town, he was (according to the Statute) carried before my Lord Keeper <hi>North</hi> then in Council; when Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> was firſt brought before his Lordſhip, my Lord Keeper ſmil'd, (thinking he had got ſuch a hank upon Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> and his Friends, as would ruine both) and told Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> notwithſtanding Self-reſpect might weigh but little, he thought that he would have had ſuch juſt regard to his Bail, as not to have ruin'd them by thoſe things then to be laid to his Charge. To which Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> anſwered, That the only thing required of his Bail, was his Appearance the next Term, which he ſhould (God willing) do, and thereby Indemnifie his Bail. No, replied my Lord Keeper (ſmiling) the Good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the mean time was likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and that hath been notoriouſly broken by this new Offence. To which it was anſwered, That there was no Good Behaviour at all required; and for the Truth thereof, Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> appealed to the Bonds themſelves, taken (as you have heard) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Secretary of State; upon ſearch it appeared his Lordſhip was in the wrong, upon which my Lord Keeper <hi>North</hi> ſeemed very Angry with Secretary <hi>Jenkins,</hi> that the Good Behaviour was here omitted; but the Secretary ſaid it was the Omiſſion of his Clerk, and it was, I believe, the only Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that nature that had happened in thoſe times; for the Bonds then taken by the Secretary of State, in their Condition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, <hi>And in the mean while to be of the Good Behaviour;</hi> but in Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Bond this Clauſe was intirely left out.</p>

                  <hi>he neither had or could demand the Good Behaviour;</hi> and then ſent for Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared as before: Whereupon Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> (perceiving his Lordſhip in a better Humour than the Night before) deſired his Lordſhip to accept of ſuch Bail as he could give; which, with what he was before under, (by Bonds before the Secretary of State, for the ſame Offence in Effect) would amount to 10000 <hi>l.</hi> my Lord Keeper declared, he could not at his Houſe alter what was agreed upon at the Council; but the Goaler ſhould bring him down to the Council that Afternoon, and if it could be done, he ſhould be then Bailed.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> having thus ſuffered in the defect of this Act, I cannot but here take notice of one great Omiſſion in this Statute. This Act inflicts a Penalty of 100 <hi>l.</hi> upon the Goaler that denies the Priſoner, or any on his behalf, a Copy of his Warrant, and 500 <hi>l.</hi> Penalty on every Judge that refuſes to grant an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> upon the Statute, for the removal of ſuch Priſoner;
<note place="margin">☞</note> but inflicts no certain Penalty upon the refuſal to Bail the Priſoner, as ſhall upon this Act be brought before them, ſo that if the Judge either demand Ten times more than the Quality of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, or the Nature of the Offence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, or refuſeth to take any Bail what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, there can no Action of 500 <hi>l.</hi> for this refuſal be brought, for no Penalty in this Caſe is Enacted. It's very ſtrange that the Statute ſhould lay ſo great Penalties upon the denial of the Means of Bail, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Copy of the Warrant and <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>) and yet not Enact an expreſs Penalty for refuſal of the End, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Bailing the Priſoner; for what ſignifies either a Copy of the Commitment, or an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> thereupon, if Bail be not procured? This is putting the Priſoner to a very Fruitleſs Expence.</p>

               <p>Upon refuſal, if there be little Damages ſuſtained (as it may happen, for though one Judge refuſe, another may grant the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner his Liberty upon Bail) and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſo proved, the Jury (being Sworn to go according to Evidence, as well in the Damages, as in the matter directly in Iſſue;) muſt go according to Proof, unleſs they think the Extravagant Verdicts of the late Times (which found 100 Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds where not one Farthing was proved) will excuſe them, in giving Fifty times more than was Sworn to be ſuſtained. Few words more in the Statute, would, I humbly conceive, have ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in this caſe; for in the Statute, where it is ſaid, That if the Judges ſhall deny any Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> by this Act re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be granted, being moved for as aforeſaid (it had been added; <hi>(Or ſhall refuſe ſuch Bail as the Quality of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and Nature of the Offence required) they ſhall ſeverally Forfeit to the Priſoner or Party grieved, the Sum of</hi> 500 l. <hi>to be recovered in manner aforeſaid.</hi> Theſe few words would have given the 500 <hi>l.</hi> for refuſal of Bail, as well as denying the <hi>Habeas Corpus;</hi> whereas without the like Clauſe, the Statute may (in Effect) be dayly evaded. But to return, Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> was hereupon turned over to <hi>Atterbury</hi> the Meſſenger, where, for about five Weeks, he lay at no leſs Charge than Four Pounds and odd Money <hi>per</hi> Week directly, beſides other collateral Expences; this being too great for his Fortune to comply with, he (after ſome oppoſition) removed himſelf to the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> (having before by a Friend agreed with Marſhal <hi>Glover</hi> upon 2000 <hi>l.</hi> Security, and 5 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d. per</hi> Week Chamber-Rent, to have the Liberty of the Rules; but when he came over, the Marſhal inſiſted upon two men in 10000 <hi>l.</hi> a piece, and

               <p>After Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> had lain ſome time under theſe hard Terms, he was Bail'd out by the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> and then renewed his Proſecution with all poſſible Induſtry and Diligence; but about the 12th of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1683. he was taken up in <hi>London,</hi> by a very ſtrange Warrant granted againſt him, by the then Court of Aldermen, or Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tulſe,</hi> the then Lord Mayor; the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant was againſt Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> as a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>ſuſpected to be diſaffected to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

                  <hi>Suſpected</hi> to be diſaffected! Sure thoſe who granted the Warrant, were very diſaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Laws, or otherwiſe they would never have iſſued out ſo ſtrange and illegal a Warrant.</p>

               <p>Upon this Warrant Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> was carried before Sir <hi>James Edwards,</hi> and after that, the then Lord Major, and laſt of all, before the King and Council, where he was falſely and maliciouſly charged with being the Author of the <hi>Proteſtant Flail;</hi> many hundreds whereof (it was then ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted) he had beſpoke about the time of <hi>Colledge</hi>'s (pretended) Plot, as a fit Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Maſſacre the King's Friends; King <hi>Charles</hi> then ſhaking one in his hand, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it was a much more dangerous Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon than the Popiſh Dagger; but after Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> had anſwered to every part of his Charge, there appeared ſo much Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, Folly, and Falſhood in the Accuſation, that His then Majeſty ordered his Diſcharge without Bail.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>This was a very malicious Proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in hopes to Ruin him; not ſo much for this, as for what he had done in the Cafe he was before ingaged in.</p>

               <p>I believe you are in the right. About this time Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> was informed, that his Royal Highneſs (diſcourſing at a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, concerning the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>) had declared he would ruin him, if all the Law or Intereſt in <hi>England</hi> would Ruin him, for rifling into the Buſineſs (or words to that effect); and thereupon Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> was perſwaded to deſiſt; but it was anſwered, That the Ruin he did expect, he did not fear, neither would by thoſe Threats be deter'd from the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Had his Royal Highneſs been indeed Innocent of this Murder, there had been few things more ſerviceable to His Highneſs than a full and clear diſcovery of the Truth in this matter; for had the Earl been a Self-murderer by a thorough Examination, and ſtrict Scrutiny, the Truth would have plainly appeared, and all Objections would have been anſwered and vaniſhed, ſo that there would not have remain'd the leaſt Colour for a Reflection on His Highneſs; or had the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> been Murdered by ſuch as did it without His Highneſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or Privity, upon a diligent and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Examination and Proſecution, theſe vile Varlets that perpetrated this helliſh Fact, being detected and puniſhed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Demerit (as it had been both His Majeſty's and Royal Highneſs's Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, as well as Duty they ſhould) His Highneſs, and all that were Innocoent would hereby have been effectually vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all Colour of Guilt; for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and Puniſhment of the Guilty, are Vindications of the Innocent. Whereas the Cauſe was ſo managed, as gave all the World juſt reaſon to ſuſpect the very truth of the Matter was of ſo deep a Dye, that it could not endure the Touch-ſtone of a ſtrict and diligent Inquiſition, leſt it ſhould
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41825:41"/>then appear (as without doubt it would) in its true Sanguine Colours; wherefore this Cauſe ſtill ſhun'd the Light, becauſe its Deeds were Evil. <hi>Sed veritas non quaerit Angulos:</hi> Truth ſeeks no Corners.</p>

               <p>To be ſhort, For it would be very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to tell all this Gentleman hath done and ſuffered upon this Account. In <hi>Hillary</hi> Term, Mr. <hi>Bradden</hi> and <hi>Hugh Speake,</hi> Eſq were try'd upon an Information exhibited againſt them by the then Attorney General; The chief thing laid to theſe Gentlemens Charge, was a Conſpiracy to procure falſe Witneſſes to prove the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Murdered by Perſons unknown, contrary to the Coroners Inqueſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Speake</hi> was Acquitted of the Conſpiracy,
<note place="margin">☞</note> and Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> only found Guilty.</p>

               <p>Such a Contradiction the Jury made, and my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Jefferies</hi> approved of the ſame. When Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> appeared in Court to be Tried,
<note place="margin">Sir <hi>R. S.</hi>
                  </note> he that was not the leaſt concern'd in the Proſecution, told him before the Information was read, That he would do his Buſineſs for him: Upon which, Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> deſired this Gentleman to have Patience to tarry till the Jury had done it to his hands; to which it was replied, I do not doubt that. The Oppreſſion of the then times, was ſtill ſure of both Judg and Jury. This Tryal was carried on with all the Fury and Malice imaginable, and this pretended Crime made worſe than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Theft or Robbery, for that tended to a private Miſchief, but this to a general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Jefferies</hi> at this Tryal, was thus repreſenting Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>'s Crime, as one of the higheſt that could be committed, expoſing it as much worſe than Burglary, Robbery, or the like, in the midſt of his Lordſhip's Railing, Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> ſmil'd; and it was (as I after heard him often declare) upon this Story coming into his mind: A Neighbour of his an illiterate plain Country-Farmer, had a Wife of as violent a Spirit as liv'd, and one day She comes into the Room where her Husband was (with ſeveral Neighbours); as ſoon as She came, tho there was not, or it ſeems had been the leaſt Colour for a Provocation, for he ſtill carried himſelf well towards her; ſhe flies into the greateſt Rage imaginable, calling him all the Names that Malice could invent, or Rage could ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and had ſhe not been prevented, might have done him ſome miſchief. The Husband in the midſt of this great Storm, well knowing all to be falſe, which the Fury of his Wife charged him with, ſtood as a Man altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unconcern'd under this Provocation, but rather appeared very pleaſant. One of his Friends asks him, how it was poſſible for him with that Temper, to receive the ſcurrilous and unjuſt Railing of that furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Woman? to which the Husband ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, calmly replied, That his Wife talked of a Man he did not know, for he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unrelated to, and unacquainted with that Perſon ſhe ſo railed againſt, and therefore what reaſon had he to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd when he was not the Perſon ſhe ſpoke of? Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> asked his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience (an infallible Evidence according to truth, to condemn or acquit) whether he was this villanous Criminal his Lordſhip was ſo furiouſly Railing againſt; and he found that Judg (by which at the laſt day he ſhall be tryed) did acquit him from that Crime which his Lordſhip's Corruption (againſt his belief) unjuſtly charged him with; and therefore he ſtood very much unconcern'd at all that his Lordſhip's cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Violence, falſely and maliciouſly, without the leaſt appearance of a Crime, applied to him; who tho the Perſon highly accuſed, was altogether Innocent either of the Offence, or thoſe far-fetched, ſtrained, and groundleſs Aggravations.</p>

               <p>The Lord Chief Juſtice, and the Kings Council, often in effect declared (if my Lord was Murdered by others) the King and Duke had an hand in it. Some of theſe Gentlemen muſt ſhortly deny their own Concluſions from the ſame Premiſſes, or elſe maintain (from the Earl's being proved Murdered) that the Duke had a hand in it. The Jury in this Caſe were twice well trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a plentiful Entertainment; and that which to ſome of them was much more grateful, <hi>(viz.)</hi> three Guineas a Man, ſo that <hi>Guilty</hi> came to a better Market, than <hi>Not Guilty</hi> would have done by two Guineas a Man.</p>

I am apt to believe ſo Charitably of ſome of theſe Jury-men, (tho too Active in ſuch Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices) that they did not foreſee the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of theſe things, but were blindly and not maliciouſly hurried on (the Knaves leading the Fools) to thoſe things which ſome have long ſince repented.

<note place="margin">☞</note> and that very Liſt was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly taken and carried to His Majeſty then in the Camp; but his Majeſty imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon ſight of his Name, called for a Pen and Ink, and with his own Hand ſo croſſed it.</p>

               <p>Thoſe concerned in this barbarous Fact, intended to uſe (and indeed did) the Coroner's Inqueſt (which the Law deſigned as the means of diſcovery of a violent Death) as the means to prevent the Detecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Villany; for having prepared a couple of Treacherous and Perjured Varlets (<hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> I mean) to miſinform the Jury, as to the (pretended) manner of Death, inſtead of diſcovering the Truth, (which would have render'd themſelves obnoxious to Puniſhment) they villainouſly contrived a Story, or rather repeated their Inſtructions, (for without doubt the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to be given the Jury, was likewiſe agreed upon before my Lord's Death; ſo that theſe Forſworn Caitifs might not be to ſeek in their Information when they came to Swear, which would have ſoon diſcovered this bloody Treachery) I ſay, repeated their Leſſon, and with this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery miſled the Jury, who were too eaſily impos'd upon. Now, though the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not ſo much to be blamed in this Coroner's Inqueſt, (which Inqueſt by the way, in all reſpects can never be juſtified) yet as to the Governments ſtanding by this Inquiſition, as what was to remain (like the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi>) without alteration: This is what all the World juſtly condemns it for. You can't but be ſo much a Lawyer and Hiſtorian, as to know that the Coroner's Inqueſt is not concluſive and final, but may be contradicted, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dayly is; ſometimes the Coroner's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt finds Men to have died of a natural Diſtemper, which after appear to have been barbarouſly Murdered. To give you one Inſtance for many, Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> (whoſe Caſe, in ſome reſpects, runs pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel with this) was by the Coroner found to have died a natural Death; but as ſoon as that Faction, which had treacherouſly Murdered him, declined in their Intereſt, it appeared this unfortunate Gentleman was treacherouſly Murdered by others. When this Murder of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbery</hi> was firſt detected, King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt was far from thinking the Proſecution of that Murder a Reflection on the Government, though there was the ſame reaſon in Law for that, as this, ſeeing in that the Gentleman died in the Cuſtody of the Law, and the Coroner found the Perſon to have died of a natural Death, and in this a <hi>Felo de ſe.</hi> Now ſeeing the Contradiction of the Coroner's Inqueſt, was the Foundation of Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, there was the very ſame ground for the like Proſecution of thoſe that did detect Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi>'s Murder; but inſtead of proſecuting the Proſecutor, King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, at <hi>Royſton</hi> laid the higheſt Injunction imaginable on all the Judges, diligently and impartially to proſecute this Murder; for in the midſt of his Judges (his Lords and Gentlemen then likewiſe ſurrounding him) he uſed theſe words, <hi>My Lords the Judges, It's lately come to my hearing, that you have now in Examination a buſineſs of Poyſoning. Lord! in what a moſt miſerable condition ſhall this Kingdom be (the only Famous Nation for Hoſpitality in the World) if our Tables ſhould become a Snare, as none could eat without danger of Life, and that</hi> Italian <hi>Cuſtom ſhould be introduced amongſt us! Therefore, my Lords, I charge you, as you will anſwer it at that great and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful day of Judgment, that you examine it ſtrictly, without Favour, Affection or Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and if you ſhall ſpare any Guilty of this Crime, God's Curſe light on you and your Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and if I ſpare any that are found Guilty, God's Curſe light on me and my Poſterity for ever.</hi> Such was His then Majeſties great Zeal for the Detection and Puniſhment, and his juſt Abhorrence of this treacherous Murder, which he then expreſſed upon the firſt diſcovery of that barbarous perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But this Caſe is under much higher Aggravations; for</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:41825:43"/>
               <p>That Gentleman was only charged (and that in truth) with a refuſal of the King's Command, in not going on that Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Embaſſy, which would have been both for his Honour and Safety; ſo that his was a Sin only of Omiſſion. But this Noble Lord was maliciouſly and falſly accuſed of the Blackeſt Treaſon, <hi>viz. Conſpiring the Death of the King,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That Gentleman's Reputation was not murdered with an Imputation of Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: But</p>
               <p>This Honourable Peer was murdered both in Perſon and Reputation, and by the Perjury of the moſt perfidious Varlets, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the Law, they villainouſly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Guilt from thoſe really Criminal, and placed it on him whom they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (by their privity and conſent) trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly and barbarouſly Murdered.</p>
               <p>That Gentleman's Murder center'd in himſelf. But the Murder of this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſon was immediately appli'd to the Murdering of another Honourable Lord, whom they were then (by their Inſtruments not ſo much corrupted with Malice as blind Obedience) villainouſly haranguing out of his Life, under form of Law and colour of Juſtice; and many more ſince murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to avoid a Detection of this their firſt moſt cruel and barbarous Treachery. Juſtice zealouſly eſpouſed the Proſecution of that worthy Gentleman's Murder; but Juſtice here became Corrupted and Retrograde; for inſtead of encouraging, and Proſecuting the Murderers, it diſcouraged, proſecuted and ruined the Proſecutor. That Food which ſhould have ſuſtained the Natural Man, was tainted with a natural, poyſonous Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and became (or at leaſt was there deſigned, for he was ſtifled between the Pillows, and died not of the Poiſon) the means of that worthy Knight's Deſtruction: But Juſtice (which ſupports the Moral Man) was here twice vitiated; firſt by Perjury and Treachery in thoſe vile perfidious Caitifs before the Coroner; and the ſecond time by Perjury (in the ſame cruel Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants in the Kings-Bench Court) at Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Tryal; and the then bare-faced Wreſting of Juſtice thorough the irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable Malice of the Chief Author of this Murder, and the groundleſs and illegal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, Conviction and Puniſhment of him, who did endeavour by proper legal Methods, to detect this helliſh complicated Villany. I ſhall follow this Compariſon no farther, but appeal to all the World, whether the latter of theſe two Murders, is not aggravated with far higher Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances than the former. And as Juſtice, after ſome time, overtook thoſe that perpetrated that treacherous Cruelty, ſo I doubt not but God in Juſtice will ſhortly bring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign Puniſhment, ſome, though not all of thoſe concerned in this not to be parallel'd piece of barbarous Cruelty.</p>

               <p>He had no reaſon to believe he ſhould by them be made very welcome, and he was ſo told by many of his Friends, which therefore diſſwaded him from proceeding. But to ſuch he did generally give ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>viz. That he could not but expect what they did ſeem to fear would befall him, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it ſhould not deter him; for ſhould none in this caſe move, the ſame Bloody Principles that took off that unfortunate Lord, might
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41825:43"/>Poiſon a ſecond, Stab a third, and Strangle a fourth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of thoſe they then had or ſhould take into Cuſtody, pretending (as they falſly did in this Caſe) that theſe unfortunate Gentlemen thus barbarouſly Murdered, had done it to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the common Methods of Juſtice, which their Guilt threatned them with; ſo that no Man could tell in how many Mens Deſtruction ſuch their treacherous and bloody Practices would determine; but if once they found that theſe their dark Deſigns were ſuſpected, and ſome of them like to be detected, they might then conclude theſe clandeſtine, perfidious, complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Murders (in Perſon and Reputation) would do them great prejudice (by raiſing up in all Mankind a general Averſion againſt thoſe blood-thirſty Men) and therefore they might deſiſt from ſuch barbarous unheard of Meaſures.</hi> And ſeeing by ſuch Service as this, the Publick would receive far greater Advantage than could be expected by this Gentleman's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; he was reſolved to Sacrifice that, or whatever elſe he had, for the good of his Generation, to whoſe Intereſt he thought any Individual was obliged to offer up his private Advantage or Safety. Neither did he believe this to be any other than what he was taught implicitely, by that Doctrine which obliged him to love an individual Neighbour as himſelf; and therein taught, that much more than Self-love ought that Love to be, which he did owe to ſo many Millions of ſuch Individuals. I have often heard this Gentleman (when he firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged) ſay, That he looked upon the World as an Army, where the bad were ſtill endeavouring the Deſtruction of their contrary. Now if a General of an Army command a Party of Men to a Poſt, by the maintaining whereof a certain time, this Party perceive they ſhall (in all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Probability) give Succeſs to their Army; but after their thus maintaining their Poſt, they ſhall (in as great probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) fall Sacrifices to the Fury of their Enemies, neither of this Party (though thus aſſured they ſhall every Man fall) ought to deſert his Poſt, becauſe every Individual Soldier, or any particular Party, is obliged to prefer and deſire the Succeſs of their whole Army, before their private Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Safety. If therefore that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which is the General of all Mankind, ſhould call a Perſon to that Service wherein he might prove extreamly uſeful to his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, ſuch Service he ought not to deſert, though thereby (through the oppreſſion of the Times) he was morally aſſured he ſhould, in his private Intereſt and Safety, fall a Sacrifice to the Oppreſſor; becauſe Self-intereſt is not to be preferred before the Good of ſo many Thouſands.</p>

               <p>Another Argument of the backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (in this caſe) of the then Government, (and of <hi>Bomeny</hi>'s Guilt in this Murder) is an account which follows, <hi>viz.</hi> About ſix Weeks after my Lord's Death, there was a Letter (unſealed) left with one Mr. <hi>Cadman,</hi> then living in <hi>Durham-Exchange;</hi> the Letter was directed to the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable the Counteſs Dowager of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> the Subſtance of this Letter was, That <hi>if her Honour could prevail with the King for the Author's Pardon, he would ingeniouſly make a full Diſcovery, how, by whom, and whoſe order my Lord was Murdered; and this Letter did aſſure her Honour, that the Duke of</hi> York <hi>and— were authorizing this Murder.</hi> This Letter ſubſcribed— <hi>P.

            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>By the Hand that writ it, and the Letters ſubſcribed, it was <hi>Paul Bomeny</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned (who did once Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly ſay, That <hi>he could as well tell how my Lord came by his Death, as God Almighty himſelf</hi>) for the Letter was very fairly writ, in a Hand between a <hi>Roman</hi> and an <hi>Italian,</hi> and ſuch an Hand <hi>Bomeny,</hi> when he would write fair, did write; beſides, the Letters ſubſcribed, are the Letters of his Name.</p>

               <p>Can it be ſuppoſed, that <hi>Bomeny</hi> would write either in his own Hand, or ſubſcribe his own Name, when the Letter, had it

               <p>I think <hi>Bomeny</hi> by this Letter, could it have been proved to be his own Writing, was in no danger at all of being puniſhed; for had they hereupon ſeized <hi>Bomeny,</hi> they would have catched a <hi>Tartar;</hi> ſhould they have proceeded againſt him for this Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, upon this Confeſſion, the World would have believed the whole Contents of this Letter to be true, and conſequently that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and — authorized (or rather) commanded this moſt treacherous Murder.

               <p>This Letter was left with <hi>Cadman</hi> when he was at his Shop within-ſide of the Counter, and very ſleepy; and when he waked, finding this Letter unſealed, he opened it, and perceiving the Contents to be of that Conſequence, he carried the Letter to a Juſtice of Peace, who did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to carry this Letter to the Secretary of State; but this Bookſeller was never ſent for, and examined whom he did ſuppoſe to be the Author of this Letter.</p>

               <p>As for his Religion, you may conclude it belonged to that Church, whoſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are dipped in the Blood of the Saints; and that this Fellows Religion was really ſuch (tho in appearance he ſeemed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe); may reaſonably be concluded from this Story, of which I have been credibly Informed. The Proteſtant Miniſter where <hi>Bomeny</hi> lived in <hi>France,</hi> after my Lord's Death, preſt <hi>Bomeny</hi> very earneſtly to deal ingeniouſly in this Caſe; for the Miniſter declared, he was very well ſatisfied my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was Murdered, and he was well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that <hi>Bomeny</hi> muſt know it; therefore the Miniſter proteſted he was not free that <hi>Bomeny</hi> ſhould come to Church, much leſs, be admitted to the Bleſſed Sacrament, till in this matter he had diſcharged himſelf. <hi>Bomeny</hi> finding himſelf thus preſſed by his Miniſter, thought it beſt openly to profeſs what he was, and the very next day decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf a Papiſt.</p>

               <p>In the Hiſtory of <hi>Suſanna</hi> it's related, <hi>That</hi> Daniel <hi>ſtanding in the midſt of the People, ſaid, Are ye ſuch fools, ye ſons of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that without examination or knowledge of the truth, ye have condemned a Daughter of</hi> Iſrael? verſe the 48th. The People had received the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of the Elders, whoſe Qualifications gave no ſmall credit to their Evidence; for it's ſaid (verſe the 41ſt) <hi>The Aſſembly believed them as thoſe that were the Elders and Judges of the Land.</hi> Nevertheleſs, <hi>Daniel</hi> juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Aſſembly, for pronouncing raſh Judgment without examination, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth. In this Caſe an Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was not to be admitted for truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrict examination of the matter; and ſuch ſcrutiny was proper, as was a-part, ſo that one might not hear the relation of the other, and thereby be enabled to agree in their Evidence, which, without doubt, they would, had they been examined together. If the Teſtimony of theſe two Elders were to be throughly ſifted by a ſtrict, judicious and ſeparate Examination, how much rather the Relation of <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> in this Caſe? for in that it did not appear (any other ways than by the defence of the Accuſed) that there was the leaſt malice in the Accuſers, or that their Intereſt, much leſs their Lives (before the Charge) depended on the truth of the Fact, (for theſe Elders had ſuffered nothing by <hi>Suſanna</hi>'s Innocence) provided they had not falſly and maliciouſly teſtified againſt her. But here it was plain to every man's underſtanding, that theſe two Mens (<hi>Bome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>'s and <hi>Ruſſell</hi>'s) very Lives lay at ſtake; for moſt certain it is, That ſuch as were in the Chamber, and kept the Chamber-door, (the Chamber not being above 14 foot ſquare, and no other way in or out) muſt be either acting in, or privy to this Barbarity, if ſuch it were; for this very reaſon this Coroner and Jury ſhould have been very inquiſitive and ſcrutinous in their Interrogations, and taken all care poſſible, that the one ſhould not have heard, or been informed of the Examination of the other; by which they would have found theſe two in greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherences and contradictions, (if poſſible) than they are now guilty of.</p>

               <p>From what <hi>Bomeny</hi> told this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he might ſafely draw that Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for Mr. <hi>B.</hi> the <hi>Sunday,</hi> or <hi>Monday</hi> after my Lords Death, asking <hi>Bomeny</hi> how long my Lord lay Dead, before he was known to be Dead; he declared, above two hours; upon which Mr. <hi>Billingſly</hi> (as he juſtly might) was very angry with <hi>Bomeny</hi> for leaving my Lord ſo long alone. Now, by comparing this Relation to what was Sworn, he muſt have found it a point-blank Contradiction; for <hi>Ruſſell</hi> depoſed, it was not half an hour from the time of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor's being delivered by <hi>Bomeny,</hi> to the time of their finding my Lord Dead in his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet; ſo the one Swore it was not half an hour; and the other ſaid, that it was above two hours (and this declared within two days after the Fact, and ſo may be ſuppoſed to be freſh in his Memory); it's plain, that one of theſe two was falſe in his Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and ſeeing theſe Mens Ralations were to acquit themſelves, as well as charge my Lord; it might be reaſonably concluded that both were falſe, and all forged, as it now plainly appears by comparing theſe Mens Relations (ſo full of Contradictions) together.</p>

               <p>The Story is this: About five Months ſince, I was very poſitively told, that the Right Honourable the Counteſs Dowager of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> deſired ſeveral Honourable Lords (ſome of which were of this Committee) and one worthy Gentleman, to meet at her Houſe, where ſhe ſpoke to them to this Effect: <hi>My Lords, I have deſired this Favour of your Lordſhips, in order to my own Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which in Self-juſtice I think my ſelf bound to do, though I am very ſorry for the occaſion. My Lords, I do underſtand I am traduc'd (out of Malice in ſome, and Indiſcretion in others) as a Woman that hath ſold the Blood of an Husband; and by a Non-proſecution tacitly conſent to his Death. My Lords, It's no pleaſure, but a great Grief to me, to ſay any thing which may ſeem in the leaſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the Memory of my Lord; and I could heartily wiſh there were not this juſt occaſion offered; Juſt I ſay, with reſpect to my ſelf, and to my Honour, much dearer than my Life; for ſhould I ſuffer my ſelf to lye under this unjuſt Scandal, without a juſt Self-vindication, by ſuch my ſilence, I ſhould make this diſhonourable Calumny become currant and credible. My Lords, My Non-proſecucion of my Husband's Death is my Charge; to which I have this to ſay, That were I well ſatisfied my Lord's Blood was treacherouſly ſpilt, I did deſerve this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and there is none could think ſo bad of me as I ſhould then of my ſelf, for my long ſilence. (My Lords) The Reaſons which makes me disbelieve my Lords being (by others) Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, are ſuch as I could never hear anſwered, though I am ſure I ſhould readily be convinced, and rejoyce in my Conviction; but till then I ſhould think my ſelf little leſs than a Murderer, to proſecute any for the ſhedding of that Blood, from the Guilt whereof (I am ſorry) I muſt, in my opinion, acquit all Men living. My Lords, The Reaſons which have thus influenced my Belief, and tied my Hands, I have at large communicated to my Lord Biſhop of</hi> S. <hi>whom I have deſired to make them known to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and your Lordſhips (being ſatisfied in my
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41825:47"/>Innocence) will, I am ſure, ſoon reſcue me from the vile Slanders of thoſe Tongues, under the laſh whereof I have ſo undeſervedly ſuffered. My Lords, I ſhall only add this, That if once theſe Objections are removed, and I become fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied my Lord was perfidiouſly Murdered, none living upon the face of the Earth, ſhall more zealouſly proſecute the Blood of a murdered Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band than I will this, as in Duty and Honour I ſhall then ſtand obliged.</hi>

               <p>And I doubt not but her Honour will zealouſly Proſecute, as ſoon as ſhe finds what is here depoſed, to prove her Lord treacherouſly Butchered: Such Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there is, that nothing can ballance, but the occular Evidence of the Self-murder, and if there be any ſuch, it's ſtrange we ſhould not long ſince have heard of the Perſon: But pray proceed.</p>

               <p>Upon this, that Learned Biſhop, as I have been told, gave a large account, what were the ſeveral Inducements that moved the Counteſs to this Belief; but I could never hear what theſe Reaſons were, but without doubt they were ſuch as had ſome weight with them, or otherwiſe they would never have ſatisfied, not only that Reverend Biſhop, but moſt then preſent, in the belief of the Self-murder; and ſo throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Mr. <hi>H.</hi> who (as I have been told) did ſecond the Biſhop, and gave ſome other Arguments for the ſame purpoſe, and ſeemed concerned, that ſome of thoſe Honourable Lords appeared to disbelieve the Self-murder.</p>

               <p>I could never yet hear, but a very imperfect Account, of what my Lord Biſhop ſaid; for the chief reaſon, as I have been told, his Lordſhip then gave, was what my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> declared juſt before his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment, when his Lordſhip (appearing under ſome diſorder and trouble of mind) ſaid, that it was not any perſonal concern that made him thus troubled, but it was the thoughts of his Family; for he was much troubled to think what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them after his death; as for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it was the leaſt of his care, For therein he was reſolved what to do; ſeveral times over repeating (in a ſeeming deſpondency) that expreſſion, <hi>As for my ſelf I am reſolved what to do</hi> — Now admitting this to be true, that the Earl ſeveral times repeated that expreſſion, <hi>As for my ſelf, I am reſolved what to do,</hi> is there no other Reſolutions but Self-murder to be ſuppoſed.</p>

               <p>Being ſpoken with ſuch Deſpondency, it argues the Reſolution was deſperate.</p>

               <p>It's very natural for love to fear the worſt, and to apply ſuch Fears according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, now her Honour being ſtartled with theſe often Repetitions, upon hearing of her Lord's death, might ſuppoſe that ſuch had been her Lord's Reſolutions, which gave Birth to thoſe repeated Expreſſions: But whereas it's ſaid, my Lord ſpoke it in a ſort of Deſpondency, it's probable that her Honour might miſtake his Lordſhip's undaunted Courage (which with a higher aſſiſtance, kept him above the fear of what the Power and Malice of his greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could inflict) for Deſparation. This, to me, ſeems the moſt likely, conſidering what his Lordſhip had before declared, <hi>viz. That he did expect the Court would not only Impriſon, but take off ſeveral; and if it ſhould be his misfortune to fall a Sacrifice for his Country, to the Court Malice and Rage, the World ſhould ſee he ceuld dye with as great Reſolution as ever his Father did, for he was ready at all times, and upon all occaſions, to lay down his Life for his Country.</hi> This Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Lord was not ignorant of the Popiſh and Arbitrary Deſigns of the Court, and that there were ſmall hopes of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs by Parliaments, for ſuch were not ſuffered to ſit when they began to reform our Grievances; and as for the then Judges, they were purely Inſtruments and Ecchoes to the Corruption of the Court; ſo that whatſoever <hi>Whitehall</hi> had reſolved upon, as fit to be declared Treaſon in <hi>Weſtminſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hail,</hi> was declared (not properly adjudged) accordingly; not adjudged, I ſay, for we found many of them more Knave than Fool, and their Intereſt corrupted their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and theſe their Tongues, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce what their Judgments in the Law
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41825:48"/>could not but be ſatisfied, was falſe, and themſelves well knew to be corrupt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only the laſt remedy remained, in caſe the Court proceeded, as there was all reaſon to believe they would, by ſuch Vile, Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, Arbitrary, Popiſh and Oppreſſive Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, to deſtroy what to every brave true Engliſh Spirit is much more valuable than Life (Religion, Liberty and Property I mean.) My Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had long ſtood in a true light, wherein he could plainly ſee the moſt ſecret and ultimate end of the Court; and this made him the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to joyn with others, ſuch Patriots as himſelf, in oppoſition to thoſe Helliſh Plots of St. <hi>James</hi>'s (for there indeed lived the true Plotters, which were indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly plotting the total Deſtruction of our Religion and Liberties, when) ſuch true Lovers of their Country, as himſelf, were deſigning nothing more than the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our Laws, which the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Bench had in Perjury ſold to the Oppreſſion of the Court. But this Bargain was never ſo plainly proclaimed, as in that Never-too-ſeverely-to-be-puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Judgment, which gave (as far as was within the Power of that perjured Bench) ſuch a Diſpencing Power to the Crown, under a neceſſity (of which neceſſity the Crown was the ſole Judge) as by a natural Conſequence diſſolved all Law, when a Royal Arbitrary <hi>Ipſe Dixit</hi> ſhould ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it: Wherefore (as before obſerved) we held our Laws, and therein our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Lives and Liberties, as theſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn, Mercenary Judges did their Places, <hi>durante bene placito Regis.</hi> Had we in this Lord's days known thoſe Popiſh and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Court-Secrets (which he plainly ſaw deſigned our ruine, but no confiderarion could ever corrupt this Honourable Lord to ingage in thoſe Curſed Cabals) moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we ſhould have reſcued the Lives of thoſe our beſt Friends, and not by a corrupt Conſtructive Treaſon, have Sacrificed thoſe true Lovers of our Country, for doing of that which we all ought as one Man to have cordially joined in. Had not thoſe brave Patriots, our Church and State Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, the moſt Reverend his Grace, and the Reverend ſix Biſhops, met with an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt Jury, which were guided by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, (not impoſed upon by the Court, but enlightned with the true State of the Caſe, as moſt judiciouſly, and truly Stated by thoſe their Learned Council in the Law); Theſe Seven Champions for our Laws (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for all by them we poſſeſs) would moſt certainly have been offered up by the Bench as Victims of Expiation for that Guilt, which would (in a Court Senſe) have robb'd the Crown of its richeſt Jewel; yea, that Court Philoſopher-Stone, (the Diſpencing Power) which at pleaſure might have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Properties, Liberties, yea, Lives, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pure Gold; for the Eſtates we poſſeſs, the Liberty we enjoy, and the Lives we live, we have guarded only (next under God) by our Laws, which this <hi>Leviathan</hi> at once would have ſwallowed and totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>

               <p>When I conſider my Lord's declared Reſolution of his not ſtirring, tho then under the like Danger, as in this Caſe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and with what Readineſs, Courage and Chearfulneſs, he could lay down his Life for his Country; and likewiſe, the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that he may be ſuppoſed to have of their Deſigns (which thoſe Villains, nine days before his Death declared;
<note place="margin">☜</note> for it's Sworn they then ſaid, The Earl knew ſo much of their Deſigns, and was ſo very Averſe to their Intereſt, that they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver carry them on, unleſs his Lordſhip was taken off, and his Lordſhip was therefore to be Murdered). I ſay, when I conſider theſe things, and that the more this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Lord knew of the black Intrigues of the Court, the more ſo good a Man, and ſo true a Patriot muſt be ſuppoſed to hate them; I can't but imagine that this brave State-Champion, when he had been once ſatisfied, that the Court under Colour of Law would have taken him off, had <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved as to himſelf,</hi> to lay open thoſe Popiſh Arbitrary-Court Contrivances, and juſtified that juſt Deſign of ſtanding upon their
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41825:48"/>Guard; there was no other way (under God) to defend what was ſo groſly invaded. Now, tho his Lordſhip might ſuppoſe by dealing thus plainly, he ſhould the more exaſperate the Court, ſo that their Malice would be more inveterately bent in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; yet, that he declared, he feared not, but was ready, chearfully, to lay down his life in ſo juſt a Cauſe; and ſhould this daring true lover of his Country have thus expired, by his State-Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he would have given ſuch ſatisfaction in the truth of what he thus couragiouſly, with his laſt breath, ſhould have affirmed, as would have raiſed a general hatred againſt thoſe Arbitrary and Popiſh-Court-Reſolutions; and this might ſo ſuddenly have given another ſo general a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to that juſt Cauſe, as would have totally routed thoſe our true and only Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of both Church and State. Our then Enemies, under colour of Law, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly endeavouring the total Subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Laws, and whilſt in ſhew they ſeemed to maintain the Proteſtant Church, they were ſecretly contriving its total De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, by wreſting thoſe very Laws which were chiefly deſigned as Deſtructive to Popery, and making them productive of what they were enacted to deſtroy; for by a malicious and furious Proſecution of all Proteſtant Diſſenters, they did hope to raiſe ſo general Animoſities between the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming and Non-conforming.

<note place="margin">☜</note> and yet this Gentleman now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies not only this ſuggeſtion, but likewiſe declared, <hi>That he never heard it ſaid to be my Lord's Principle, till their Lordſhips in this Committee charged him with it. Hawley</hi>'s Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion to the Jury, I do not doubt, for it's poſitively ſworn againſt him; but the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the thing ſuggeſted is plain from <hi>Hawley</hi>'s now denying it: and that this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had its riſe from the ſame Malice that contrived his Lordſhip's Deſtruction. For had this Principle been true, How readily would <hi>Hawley</hi> have juſtified it, as of what he had been credibly informed? and how ſerviceable might he have thought it to prove the Self-murther? But this Gentleman
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41825:49"/>being conſcious where this pretended Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple was hatched,
<note place="margin">☞</note> and what villanous uſe he himſelf (according to Inſtruction and Order) made of it to the Jury; thought it not ſafe to juſtify either his Suggeſtion, or his having ſo much as heard it, before my Lord's death, to be his Lordſhip's Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple: for ſhould he have been forc'd to produce (to him) the Authors of this (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) Principle, it would too plainly have appeared, that theſe his Authors were the Forgers of the Story. But I will for the preſent admit, what I am well aſſured you can't credibly prove, That before my Lord's death, his Lordſhip had declared, <hi>that Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther (in ſome Caſes) was lawful;</hi> it doth not from thence inevitably follow, that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip therefore muſt cut his own Throat; for ſome have juſtified the Principle, that never thought fit to put it in practice. I will, for Argument ſake, admit yet farther, That <hi>Hawley</hi>'s ſuggeſted Principle was true <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> declared he would deſtroy himſelf, rather than be brought to a diſhonourable and infamous Death; can it be thought, that from this general Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (wherein no particular manner of death is declared) all thoſe ſeveral previous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, before obſerved, ſhould riſe? for (to borrow almoſt the very words of an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Author upon this Occaſion; <hi>Though they were vented by ſeveral perſons, yet they not only agreed in the matter of the Earl of</hi> Eſſex<hi>'s Death; but they accorded alſo in the way, and manner of it, and place where, namely, that he cut his Throat in the</hi> Tower: which plainly ſhews, that it was not vulgar Tattle, vented at random, but had its foundation in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and fixed Reſolution, that he ſhould undergo that unhappy Fate, both as to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and place; nothing but a determinate Cauſe can produce a ſteddy and determinate Effect: Had the Report taken its riſe in the Jealouſies of his Friends, or owed its breath to the fearful Apprehenſions of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, they would have rather dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his being poiſoned, as being more ſafe for the Actors to perpetrate, and requiring the acceſſion of fewer hands, than have ever imagined that his Throat ſhould be cut. It's impoſſible to conceive, that the Reports of ſo many ſeveral Perſons ſhould not only agree in the matter of his Death, but all harmonize and center in the very Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and manner of it, and Place where, unleſs it had originally proceeded from ſuch as had contrived and determined both the Murther it ſelf, and the way wherein it ſhould be committed, and the Place where it ſhould be done. For when Reports have their foundation only in Mens Fancies, they will always vary according to the different Tempers, Paſſions, and Complexions of the Reporters; how could ſo many Perſons, and at ſuch diſtances from one another, and betwixt whom there was never any corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence, agree and combine together to impoſe upon the World, and to abuſe the Faith of Mankind? and as they all ſeem to be Perſons who abhor Tricks, and who would not be guilty of ſpreading, much leſs of raiſing a falſe Report; ſo it is beyond the Wit of Man, to declare, how it ſhould come to the Intereſt of Gentlewomen, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and Countrey Tradeſmen, to be the Authors of ſuch a Story, that my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat in the <hi>Tower</hi> before it was done, or before knowledge of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment in the <hi>Tower</hi> could arrive at ſome of theſe Places, where it was ſo reported.

<note place="margin">☜</note> that the Matter was ſo particularly agreed upon by the Papiſts, and <hi>this</hi> Reaſon by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be given out juſt after my Lord's Death; it's plain to all, but thoſe that wink hard, that this pretended Reaſon muſt be hammered out of the Popiſh Forge. For this Reaſon carried in it what none but the moſt ſecret in this Helliſh Contrivance could before my Lord's Death give out; for obſerve, the Reaſon declares, That the

But of this I have already ſpoken; and alſo how this ſo particular a Report, as to the <hi>Manner, Place,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> became thus reported in the Countrey ſo long before my Lord's Death.</p>

               <p>It may be, my Lord having heard the Papiſts had reſolved to cut his Throat, was afraid they would (the more to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him) not do it like themſelves, but botchingly (as they cut Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi>'s) and therefore that it might be done at a jerk, and all perfectly finiſh'd at a ſtroak, he was reſolved to do it himſelf, and did it effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually; for though the Blade of the Razor without the Hand, was not two Inches and a half, he made a Wound about three Inches and half deep (and therein did what by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers was Mathematically impoſſible to be done) and whereas, before that Accident, it was the Opinion of Doctors and Chyrurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that none could cut through both Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Arteries to the Neck-bone on both ſides the Neck, his Lordſhip was reſolved to give the World demonſtration of their miſtake; and after all, his Lordſhip ſtopt the Orifice from giving iſſue to ſuch a quantity of Blood and Spirits, as would naturally have inſtantly killed him; and out of malice to the living, that others might be charged with his Death, threw the Razor out of the Window, and then ſent the Maid down for it; which having received from her, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to his Cloſet, lockt himſelf in, and quietly laid himſelf down, and the Razor by him, and then gave free paſſage to that Blood, and thoſe Spirits, which he thus miraculouſly kept ſo long in.</p>

               <p>All the account can be had of him, is this, That not long after the Earl's Death, he was drawn out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and ſent beyond Seas to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and there, at ſome fort, ſhot to death, but upon what account we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not learn.

               <p>Several Reports were as induſtriouſly as maliciouſly ſpread about Town when Mr. <hi>Hawley</hi> was firſt miſs'd; ſome to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence people to believe, that this Mr. <hi>Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> through diſcontent with his Wife, was very melancholly, and had declared, 'twas better to make away with himſelf, than live ſuch a vexatious life with ſo turbulent a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited a Woman; but in this they moſt groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſed them both; for no Woman could ſhew greater reſpect to a Husband, nor any Husband be more kind to a Wife. Another Report was, That Mr. <hi>Hawley</hi> had often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, He did really believe, if a man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from his Relations, and Friends, for half a year (and ſuffered none who knew him to know where he was; but to poſſeſs all men by ſuch his conce aled abſence that he was indeed dead) and then to appear in a ſurprize amongſt his Relations, this great ſurprize would be as pleaſing to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that withdrew, as it would be aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Friends; and therefore it was (pretended to be) believed by ſome, that Mr. <hi>Hawley</hi> had privately withdrawn under this Conſideration; but ſix Weeks diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Perſon, and time may likewiſe detect thoſe Bloody and Barbarous Men that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered him. They were ſo very cruel in this Murther, that his Face was ſo changed through violence, that it could not be known to be his; and there was nothing that did more (if any thing did beſides) diſcover the Body to be his, than his having three Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon one Leg, and two Stockings and a Seer-cloath upon the other: as for his Cloathes, they were ſtript off, and nothing but Stockins and Shooes remaining on when the Body was found.</p>

               <p>That the Father was turned out about nine days after Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Tryal, is very true, and this done by ſpecial Order, under King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's own Hand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cauſe ſhown, or any reaſon to be gueſſed at, any other than his Son's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>

               <p>Your ſaying that the Relation of a Wife, will not juſtifie the Concealment of a Murder by the Husband, puts me in mind of a very remarkable Story of that kind, and the Relation is this; <hi>A certain Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being Melancholly, Peeviſh and ill-natur'd, carried himſelf very ill-humour'd towards his Wife, (a very fine virtuous Lady) many times beating her, though ſhe behaved her ſelf, in all reſpects, as a Woman of very great Vertue and Obſervance towards her Husband, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured what ſhe could to conceal her Husband's Cruelty towards her; but the Matter was ſo Notorious, that her ill uſage could not be kept ſo ſecret, but that many of her Neighbours knew it to be too true; amongſt the reſt, a certain Gentleman extreamly pitied this unfortunate Lady, for whom (though he kept it unknown from the Lady) this Gentleman had a very great kindneſs, and hoped he might Marry her when her Husband died, of which there had been a long expectancy, the Husband being very Conſumptive: But his Diſeaſe out-lived this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Patience; wherefore he was reſolved to Murder the Husband (that he might Marry the Wife) yet this kept ſo very private from the knowledge of the Wife, that nothing was far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from her thoughts, than ſuch Treachery (for this Gentleman, and her Husband, in ſhew, were intimate Friends.) This Bloody Man, one day walking with the Husband, nigh a very large deep Pond, endeavoured to throw him in; and as he was about it, the Husband told him, That ſome of thoſe very Ducks then in the Pond, ſhould detect that perfidious Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he was about to commit: To which the other replied, He would venture that, and ſo threw him in, where he was drowned; but being well known to be extreamly Melancholly, it was generally believed, that in ſome Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Diſtraction (to which he had been ſubject) he threw himſelf into the Pond, and there drowned himſelf. This was generally believed, and none ſeemed in the leaſt to doubt the truth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it.</hi> Some <hi>time after the Husband's Death, this Murderer Courts the Widow, and Marries her, after which they lived very happy toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſome conſiderable time; at length, one night as ſome Ducks were roaſting at the Fire, the Husband, looking on the Ducks, burſt out into a great Laughter; the Wife deſired to know at what he laughed; to which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, At ſomewhat of which the ſight of the Ducks put him in mind; the Wife deſired him to tell what that was; but he pray'd her to excuſe him, for he would not tell. The more averſe he was to reveal it, the more deſirous ſhe ſeemed of knowing, but the Husband would not then diſcover it to her: That night as they were together in Bed, the Wife did again renew her former requeſt, in which being very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, the Husband (after he had ſolemnly enjoyned her to Secrecy) gave her a particular account of the Murder of her Husband, which in ſubſtance you have before heard. The Wiſe was hereupon extreamly concerned, though in words ſeemed then not much to reſent it, but the next Morning ſhe repaired to ſome judicious Friend (and notwithſtanding her promiſe of Secrecy, ſhe could not be quiet in her mind till ſhe had revealed it) and deſired advice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; to which ſhe was anſwered, That if ſhe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41825:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>concealed the Murder, ſhe thereby conſented to it; and though her firſt Husband was very cruel, and this as kind, the firſt Husband's Blood, thus treacherouſly ſpilt, cry'd for Vengeance, in which ſhe would moſt certainly partake, if ſhe did not diſcover her Husband's Confeſſion, wherein there ſeemed to be a very remarkable Providence. The Wife objected the nearneſs of the Relation, and the promiſe of Secrecy, but to both theſe ſhe was anſwered, That there is no Relation ſo dear as Juſtice, and no Promiſe, contrary to the Rules thereof, ought to be made, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

The Wife being thus perſwaded, repairs to the Magiſtrate, who forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with orders the Husband to be ſeized, who as ſoon as apprehended, confeſſed the whole Matter, and was deſervedly executed.</hi>

<note place="margin">13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> That if the Wife, or the neareſt Relation in Blood, or a Friend which was as his own Soul, did but ſo much as ſecretly intice to Idolatry, the Relation or Friendſhip in this caſe, was to be no Impediment to the Diſcovery, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution and Puniſhment; for the Perſon thus inticed, was not to pity, ſpare or conceal his Relation or Friend, but was poſitively commanded to Kill him; his Hand was firſt to be upon him, and then the Hand of all the People.

One day, as he was Abuſing her, ſhe was heard to ſay, <hi>He was a Murderous Rogue;</hi> and ſhe told him, <hi>That he could not but remember that ſhe could hang him when ſhe pleaſed:</hi> To which <hi>Holmes</hi> anſwered, <hi>That he little thought ſhe would have ſpoken of it, who of all the World had the leaſt reaſon.</hi> For ſaid this ſcurrilous Follow, <hi>You Bitch, you Whore, don't you remember, that I bought you a good</hi> Sattin <hi>Gown and Petticoat, and therefore you above all the World ought not to prate:</hi> To which ſhe replied, <hi>He was a Murderous Rogue for all that.</hi>

               <p>By the falling out of Murderers, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is many times detected; a very notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inſtance of which, I have often heard related, which was as followeth: <hi>A Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and his Servant in the Night, carrying a Gentleman down the River, whom they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have a great Charge about him, theſe perfidious Villains by Signs, concluded to throw this Gentleman Over-board, which they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and ſo drowned him, and then ſhared the Spoil; ſoon after which, they both lived much beyond their former Circumſtances, at which all that knew them, admired; but none but themſelves knew the reaſon, till many years after, when theſe two being Drunk, and at Play, fell out about their Game, and they were then over-heard to accuſe one the other, in this matter, the Maſter the Man, and the Man the Maſter, as the moſt Criminal. Upon which they were both Seized, and they then Confeſſed the whole Matter, each endeavouring to aggravate the Guilt of the other, in Mitigation of his own.</hi> But they were both thought deſerving of Death for their cruel Treachery, and were Executed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>

               <p>In this I ſhall readily ſerve you, but I ſhall not obſerve the very ſame Method as before, but ſhall begin with the <hi>Diſproof</hi> of my Lord's Self-murder, by deſtroying thoſe forged Informations which would prove him ſo; and Secondly, ſhall prove him barbarouſly Murdered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the diſproof of the Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>The Right Honourable <hi>Arthur</hi> late Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> was Committed to the <hi>Tower, Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the 10th of <hi>July,</hi> 1683. and there were placed over his Lordſhip two Warders, <hi>(viz.) Monday</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and one Servant, <hi>(viz.) Paul Bomeny,</hi> permitted to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on my Lord; the very next <hi>Friday</hi> morning, about Nine of the Clock, his Lordſhip was found Dead in his Cloſet, with his Throat cut through both Jugular Arteries, to the Neck-bone.</p>
               <p>Now, ſeeing our Law preſumes every Man deſtroyed by violent Hands, is Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by others, unleſs ſuch Evidence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as gives Satisfaction in the contrary,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41825:54"/>and proves him a Self-murderer. This Lord had been found barbarouſly Murdered, had not <hi>Bomeny, Monday,</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> appeared to prove otherwiſe; and they endeavour to prove it (ſhortly) thus.</p>
               <p>My Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> (they ſay) called for a Pen-knife to pare his Nails, which Pen-knife not being ready, he required a Razor, which was accordingly delivered him, with which his Lordſhip having pared his Nails, he retired into his Cloſet, and locks himſelf in, and there cut his Throat; the Razor (before delivered to pare his Nails) lying by the Body.</p>
               <p>But that this Relation is forged, and that there was, <hi>Firſt,</hi> no Razor delivered to my Lord to pare his Nails, nor had his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip pared his Nails with any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Neither the Body locked into the Cloſet: Nor,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Razor lying locked in by the Body, when my Lord was firſt know to be Dead, is evident from what follows, which clearly detects this Forgery. For the firſt of theſe, that there was no Razor delivered to my Lord.</p>
               <p>This appears by the Contradictions of <hi>Bomeny, Ruſſel</hi> and <hi>Monday,</hi> as to the time of the delivery of this Razor; for <hi>Bomeny</hi> firſt Swears, he delivered this Razor to my Lord to pare his Nails on <hi>Friday</hi> morning at eight of the Clock; and within two hours, poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſwears in the Depoſition himſelf writ, that he delivered it on <hi>Thurſday</hi> morning, at Eight of the Clock (being the day before his Death); and this as to the <hi>Thurſday,</hi> he ſwears Poſitively and Circumſtantially; Poſitively, for he doth expreſsly name <hi>Thurſday,</hi> as the day on which the Razor was delivered; and Circumſtantially, for he doth ſwear the Razor was delivered the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next Morning after my Lord came to Captain <hi>Hawley</hi>'s; and his Lordſhip went to <hi>Hawley,</hi> on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 11th of <hi>July.</hi> But</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ruſſel</hi> Swears a Point-blank Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>Bomeny</hi>'s Oath; for <hi>Ruſſel</hi> depoſeth, and now declares, That on <hi>Friday</hi> Morning, in leſs than half an hour before they found my Lord Dead in his Cloſet, he ſtood as Warder at my Lord's Chamber-door, (<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> that Morning having firſt ſtood as War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on my Lord, and was then gone down to ſtand below Stairs) and heard my Lord ask <hi>Bomeny</hi> for a Pen-knife to pare his Nails; which being not ready, his Lordſhip requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Razor, which he did immediately ſee <hi>Bomeny</hi> deliver his Lordſhip. But</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monday</hi> doth as directly give the lye to <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> as <hi>Ruſſel</hi> did to <hi>Bomeny;</hi> for <hi>Monday</hi> the day may Lord dy'd, declared, he ſaw my Lord have a Razor in his Hand, paring his Nails with it, at Seven a Clock that Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Lord died, and this about two hours before <hi>Ruſſel</hi> came up, to ſtand as Warder at my Lord's Chamber-door.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, unleſs it can be reconciled how this Razor ſhould be delivered <hi>Thurſday</hi> Morning at Eight of the Clock, according to <hi>Bomeny</hi>'s Oath; and yet not delivered till <hi>Friday</hi> Morning Nine of the Clock, within half an hour of the time his Lordſhip was found Dead, and delivered whilſt <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſtood Warder at the Chamber-door, as <hi>Ruſſel</hi> depoſeth; and notwithſtanding this, my Lord to have had the Razor, and pared his Nails with it, two hours before <hi>Ruſſel</hi> came up Stairs to ſtand Warder at my Lord's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as <hi>Monday</hi> declared, the very day my Lord died. I ſay, Unleſs theſe Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can be reconciled, it can't be thought that any Razor at all was delivered: And then, whereas all declared my Lord pared his Nails with the Razor; by ſtrict Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it appeared his Lordſhip's Nails were not newly, before his Death, either pared or ſcraped.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Cloſet-door was not locked upon my Lord's Body, appears by the Contradictions of theſe three, as to the opening the Cloſet-door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bomeny</hi> firſt ſwore, He did open the Door, (when my Lord would not anſwer upon his knocking at the Door) and there ſaw my Lord lying Dead in his Blood, and the Razor by him, and he then called the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41825:54"/>Warders; but immediately ſwears in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to his firſt Oath, that he peeped through a Chink of the Door, and ſaw Blood and part of the Razor, and then without opening the Door, ran and called <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> who thereupon firſt opened the Door: And at Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Tryal, Swears he knew not who opened the Door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ruſſel</hi> depoſeth he did firſt open the Door, and makes no difficulty in it; then comes <hi>Monday,</hi> and gives the lye to both: For</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monday</hi> (the very day my Lord died) declared (what he hath ſince often confirm'd) That neither <hi>Bomeny</hi> or <hi>Ruſſel</hi> could ſtir the Door, my Lord's Body lay ſo cloſe and hard againſt the Door; and he being ſtronger than either, put his Shoulders againſt the Door, and preſſing with all his might, broke it open.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever there is, that can reconcile theſe Contradictions (in theſe three Mens Relations) and make all appear credible,
<q>— Erit mihi Magnus Apollo.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A further Argument, That the Cloſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door was not locked upon the Body, appears by my Lord's Legs lying upon the Threſhold of the Cloſet-door, when the Body was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to have been ſtired from its firſt Poſture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That there was no Razor lying locked in with the Body, when the Body was firſt found, appears by the bloody Razor's being thrown out of my Lord's Chamber-Window, (which is about ſeventeen Foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the Cloſet-door, where the Body lay) and no noiſe of my Lord's Death, till after the Maid carried up the Razor, which Maid thereupon firſt diſcovered my Lord's Death.</p>
               <p>And, as yet other Arguments of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of theſe perfidious Villains, add the Mathematical Impoſſibility of the Wound, ſeeing not above two Inches of the Razor muſt be without my Lord's Hand, (had he done it himſelf) and yet the Wound above three Inches deep. Moreover, by many Eminent Doctors and Chyrurgions, the Wound is thought to be naturally Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have been done by my Lord himſelf, becauſe upon cutting the firſt Jugular Artery, ſuch an Effuſion of Blood and Spirit would have immediately thereupon followed, that Nature would not have been ſtrong enough for to cut through the other Jugular Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to the Neck-bone on the other ſide; much leſs, to make ſo many, and ſo large Notches in the Razor againſt the Neck-bone, as an old Fooliſh or K — Chyrurgion ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to the Coroncis Jury.</p>
               <p>Wherefore by what is before obſerved, as to the many Contradictions, it plainly appears, that theſe three (as it is ſaid in the Hiſtory of <hi>Suſanna, Verſe</hi> 61.) are convicted of falſe Relations by their own Mouths; and thoſe other Arguments before obſerved, are further Detections of theſe three Men's Perjuries. It then remains as at firſt, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That here is a Body found Dead by violent Hands, and the manner of the Death not diſcovered, (for it can't be, according to theſe three Mens Relations, for the Reaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved). The Concluſion that the Law makes in ſuch Caſes, in this therefore holds good, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That this Honourable Lord was Murdered by the violent and cruel Hands of barbarous and bloody minded Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Proof of the Murder. In this I ſhall firſt conſider what is moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, which paſſed before my Lord's Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The day of his Death. And then</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> After the day of his Death The</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Before my Lord's Death. I ſhall conſider,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The previous Reſolutions by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts to cut my Lord's Throat. And then,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The many previous Reports be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Lord's Death, that his Lordſhip had cut his Throat in the <hi>Tower.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe, <hi>D. S.</hi> declares, <hi>That about nine Days before the Death of the late Earl of</hi> Eſſex, <hi>ſhe heard ſeveral Papiſts conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together, concerning the ſaid Earl: And
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41825:55"/>this Informant heard them ſay, the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>was to be taken off, and that they had been with His Highneſs, and His Highneſs was firſt for Poyſoning the Earl; but that manner of Death being objected againſt; it was then ſaid, one did propoſe to His Highneſs, Stabbing the Earl; but this way His Highneſs did not like: at length His Highneſs concluded, and ordered his Throat to be cut, and His Highneſs had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be there when it was done.</hi> Some few days after, ſome of the aforeſaid Perſons declared, <hi>It was reſolved the Earl's Throat ſhould be cut, but they would give it out, that he had done it himſelf; and if any ſhould deny it, they would take them, and puniſh them for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the previous Reports before my Lord's Death.</p>
               <p>It's proved by eight ſeveral Witneſſes, That before the Earl's Death, (or before it could be known) it was Reported, That the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat in the <hi>Tower;</hi> amongſt the reſt, it was at <hi>Froome,</hi> which is about an hundred Miles from <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Morning; and at the ſame time, at <hi>Andover,</hi> about Sixty Miles from <hi>London,</hi> tho at neither of theſe Places, eſpecially the former, could it then be known, that the Earl was a Priſoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi> his Lordſhip being not committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> till the <hi>Tueſday</hi> in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. All theſe Reports agreed in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>How, (viz.)</hi> cutting his Throat, and the place <hi>Where, (viz.)</hi> the <hi>Tower;</hi> and (which is further) at <hi>Andover,</hi> the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Morning before my Lord's Death, it was reported, not only in the manner <hi>How,</hi> and place <hi>Where,</hi> but likewiſe the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Reaſon <hi>Wherefore,</hi> was given; for it was then, and there ſaid, That the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> being a Priſoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that the K. and Duke were come into the <hi>Tower,</hi> his Lordſhip was afraid the K. would have come up into his Chamber, and ſeen him; of which his Lordſhip's Guilt and Shame would not bear the thoughts, and therefore he did cut his Throat to avoid it. This being declared two days before my Lord's Death, when it could not have been in the leaſt fore-thought, that the King and Duke would have come together into the <hi>Tower,</hi> where they had not been above twice together ſince the Reſtoration. I ſay, This previous Report, which ſo particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloathed this Action with the <hi>how, where,</hi> and <hi>wherefore,</hi> clearly proves, That all things were ſo reſolved upon to be done, or otherwiſe it is impoſſible it ſhould have been reported under theſe three Eſſential Qualifications, as to <hi>Manner, Place,</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> before it was indeed done, eſpecially at <hi>Andover,</hi> where it could not then be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be known that my Lord was ſo much as a Priſoner in the <hi>Tower;</hi> this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Papiſts themſelves gave out juſt after my Lord's Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What paſſed the day my Lord died.</p>
               <p>Theſe then attending on my Lord, <hi>(viz.) Ruſſel</hi> and <hi>Monday,</hi> the Warders; <hi>Bomeny</hi> the Servant, and <hi>Lloyd</hi> the Centinel at the Door, did all deny that day my Lord died, that there were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> any Men let into my Lord's Lodgings that Morning, before my Lord's Death. But it now appears, That there were ſome Ruffians, a little before my Lords Death, ſent into his Lodgings to Murder him, which they did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R. M.</hi> a Soldier in the <hi>Tower,</hi> that Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was Murdered; about one of the Clock, that very day, nigh <hi>Aldgate,</hi> told <hi>B.</hi> and his Wife, <hi>That the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>did not cut his own Throat, but was barbarouſly Murdered by his Royal Highneſs's Order:</hi> For the ſaid <hi>Meake</hi> declared, <hi>That juſt before the Earl's Murder, His Highneſs ſent two Men to the Earl's Lodgings to Murder him, which after they had done, they threw the Razor out of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</hi> Likewiſe, a Soldier that Morning in the <hi>Tower,</hi> about Eleven of the Clock, that very Morning my Lord died, in <hi>Baldwins Gardens,</hi> informed <hi>G.</hi> and <hi>H. That the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>did not cut his own Throat, but was barbarouſly Murdered by his Royal Highneſs's own Order.</hi> For the ſaid <hi>R.</hi> then declared, <hi>That a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41825:55"/>little before the Earls Murder, his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs parted a little way from His Majeſty, and then two Men were ſent into the Earls Lodgings, to Murder my Lord; which when they had done, they did again return to his Highneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>E.</hi> declares, <hi>That he ſaw his Royal Highneſs, juſt before the Earl's Death, part a little from his Majeſty, and then beckoned to two Gentlemen to come to him, who came according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; His Highneſs thereupon ſent them towards the Earl of</hi> Eſſex<hi>'s Lodgings, and about a quarter of an hour after, this Informant ſaw theſe very two Men return to His Highneſs, and as they came, they ſmiled; and to the beſt of this Informant's hearing, and remembrance, ſaid, The Buſineſs was done; upon which His Highneſs ſeemed very well pleaſed, and then went to His Majeſty, to whom the news was immediately brought, That the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>had cut his Throat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lloyd,</hi> the Centinel at my Lord's Door the day my Lord dyed (till the 21ſt of <hi>January</hi> laſt) did deny the letting in of any men, (and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> and <hi>Monday</hi> ſtill deny it) but now <hi>Lloyd</hi> doth confeſs, That juſt before my Lord's Death, two or three Men, by Major <hi>Hawley</hi>'s ſpecial Order, were let in, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately he heard them (as he did ſuppoſe they were) go up ſtairs into my Lord's Room, where there was a very great buſtle and ſtir, ſo great, that this Centinel decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he would have forced after them, had not the firſt Door been made faſt; upon the buſtle, he heard ſomewhat thrown down like the fall of a Man, which he did ſuppoſe was my Lord's Body; ſoon after which, it was cryed out, <hi>My Lord of</hi> Eſſex <hi>hath out his Throat.</hi> Here is not only theſe mens going in, but a great buſtle confeſſed immediately thereupon to enſue in my Lord's Room, and the Body of a Man in this buſtle to be thrown down; this is in a Cloſe Priſoner's Room, where no one is admitted, but his Servant; and thoſe that kept the Door de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd upon Oath that any were in my Lord's Chamber that Morning my Lord died, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death. But theſe Warders being ſuppoſed privy to the Fact, would not own the admitting of thoſe Men, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves let in with ſuch a murtherous Deſign; and it is to be preſumed, that this Centinel was not a ſtranger to the matter, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined to ſecrecy; for otherwiſe he would never have declared to a Friend, under a repeated requeſt of ſecrecy, that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion (as before) laid upon his Conſcience, and troubled him night and day; for tho' it was indeed very true, that he did let in theſe Men, it was what he ſhould not have confeſſed. This Confirmation to his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance (under a great and repeated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of ſecrecy) argues, <hi>firſt,</hi> That this Confeſſion was indeed true. And</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there is ſome curſed Confederacy (it's probable by Oath) entred into to ſtifle this Murther; for what other probable Reaſon can be aſſigned for that trouble of Conſcience in this Confeſſion,
<note place="margin">☜</note> ſeeing himſelf at the ſame declared it was true, tho' he ſhould not have ſaid it? There are ſome other Arguments that this Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel was <hi>particeps Crimines</hi> in the Privity; firſt, his Retraction in part of what he did confeſs: for, upon his being firſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, he owned the throwing out of the Razor before my Lord's death was known; but he now retracts, and diſowns it. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtance of his Privity is his now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicating, in his now pretending that theſe men were let in an hour, or more, before my Lord's death; whereas, at firſt, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared they were let in immediately before my Lord's death; for, as ſoon as let in, he heard ſeveral go up ſtairs into my Lord's Room, and heard the buſtle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as before. A third Argument of this Centinel's Privity, is his not declaring the whole Truth, which he muſt know; for one at a greater diſtance, that ſaw theſe Ruſſians as they were buſtling with my Lord, and heard the buſtle, did likewiſe hear one of theſe in the buſtle (as it ſeemed to be) and therefore preſumed to be my Lord, cry out very loud, and very dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, <hi>Murther, murther, murther.</hi> The Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel who could hear the trampling, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the very walking in my Lord's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, could not but hear this <hi>Murther,</hi> ſo loud and often repeated. It appears by five
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41825:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>Cuts in my Lord's Right Hand <hi>(viz.)</hi> two upon his Fore-finger,
<note place="margin">☞</note> one upon upon the Fourth Finger, another on the Little Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, and the fifth about two Inches long in the Palm of his Right Hand; that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in this buſtle made great reſiſtance, for theſe Cuts can be ſuppoſed to be done no otherwiſe, than by endeavouring to put off the Cruel Inſtrument of his Death.</p>
               <p>The next thing that I ſhould obſerve, which happened the day my Lord dy'd, and gives us reaſon to believe the Murther, is the Irregularities committed upon the Body, before the Jury ſaw the Body; the Body was ſtript and waſhed, and the Room and Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet waſhed, and my Lord's Cloathes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away (tho' all men know the Body ſhould have remained in its firſt poſture till the Coroner's Jury had ſeen the Body.) Sir <hi>T. R.</hi> (as himſelf ſaith) declared to the Lords, <hi>That the Body was not ſtirred from its firſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture till the next morning about Ten of the Clock;</hi> to this Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> hath not ſworn (for he was not ſworn before the Lords) and its well he hath not,
<note place="margin">☞</note> for herein he is ſo much miſtaken, that the contrary can be proved by almoſt twenty Witneſſes. Had the Body remained in its firſt poſture, by my Lord's Cravat's being cut in three parts, the Jury would have plainly ſeen, that his Lordſhip could not ſo do it with the Razor; and then ſecondly, they would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the print of a bloody Foot upon my Lord,
<note place="margin">☞</note> as he lay in the Cloſet, by which it appeared ſome one had been with the Body in the Cloſet; and ſeveral other Material Circumſtances might have been diſcovered, which by the total (illegal) alteration of the Circumſtances of the Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>About Three of the Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, that day my Lord died, ſome of thoſe bloody Men (who had been at the Conſult) met at <hi>Homes</hi>'s Houſe, and one of them leaped about the Room, as overjoyed; and as the Maſter of the Houſe came into the Room, he ſtrikes him upon the Back, and cry'd, <hi>the Feat was done,</hi> or, <hi>we have done the Feat;</hi> upon which the Maſter ſaid, <hi>is the Earls Throat cut?</hi> to which the other replied, <hi>Yes;</hi> and farther ſaid, <hi>he could not but laugh to think how like a Fool the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>looked when they came to cut his Throat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To deſtroy the Teſtimony of this <hi>D. S. Homes</hi> hath produced Two Witneſſes, who (by many Witneſſes) appear to be forſworn in every part of their Depoſitions. His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence being falſe, his Charge therefore may be concluded true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> What paſt after the day of my Lord's Death.</p>
               <p>That very Morning ſeveral Soldiers (which were preſumed able to diſcover what was material, with relation to my Lord's Death) were called together (as <hi>M.</hi> then ſaid) and enjoined to ſecrecy under very ſevere Penalties.</p>
               <p>About Ten of the Clock in the Morning, the next day after my Lord's Death, the Jury met, and were ſurprized to ſee all the Circumſtances of my Lord's Body changed from what was firſt diſcovered.</p>
               <p>After the Jury had ſeen the Naked Body at <hi>Hawleys,</hi> the Coroner adjourned them to a Victualling-Houſe in the <hi>Tower,</hi> when one of the Jury demanded a ſight of the Cloathes; but the Coroner was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called into the next Room, from which returning to the Jury in ſome heat, he told them, <hi>It was the Body, and not the Cloathes, they were to ſit upon; the Body was there, and that was ſufficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of the Jury then ſaid, <hi>My Lord of</hi> Eſſex <hi>was eſteemed a very Sober, Sedate and Good Man</hi> (which <hi>Bomeny</hi> then confirmed, ſaying, <hi>His Lord was a very Pious Man) and therefore it was improbable ſo Good a Man ſhould be Guilty of the worſt of Actions.</hi> Upon which M. <hi>Hawley</hi> told the Jury, <hi>They were miſinformed in my Lord's Character, for every Man that was well acquainted with my Lord, well knew, that it had ever been a ſixed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in my Lord, that any Man might cut his Throat, or any otherwiſe diſpoſe of his Life, to avoid a diſhonourable and infamous Death; wherefore this Action which they thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like his Lordſhip, was according to my Lord's
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41825:56"/>avowed and fixed Principles.</hi> This made the Jury the more eaſie believe, that my Lord had indeed done it.</p>
               <p>Some of the Jury were for Adjourning their Inquiſition to ſome further day, and in the mean time to ſend notice to the Earl's Relations, ſo that if any thing appeared on my Lord's behalf, it might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. <hi>Hawley,</hi> hereupon, aſſured the Jury, <hi>That they could not adjourn their Inquiry, for His Majeſty had ſent one for their Inquiſition, and would not riſe from Council till it was brought him.</hi> This the Jury believing, immediately made all haſte poſſible, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as otherwiſe they might have been more ſtrict and particular in their Examinations. <hi>Hawley,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> in anſwer to this, totally denies all, and proteſts that he was not nigh the Jury in the Victualling-houſe all the time the Jury ſate, though moſt of the Jury can ſay the contrary; and as for the ſuggeſting Self-murder to be my Lord's Principle, he did proteſt he did never hear it ſaid to be my Lord's Principle, till their Lordſhips in this Committee told him it had been ſo declared.
<note place="margin">☞</note> This clearly proves, that the pretended Principle of Self-murder, was a Forgery of that Bloody Party which mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my Lord, and <hi>Hawley</hi> pitched upon as the moſt proper Perſon to corrupt the Jury with the belief of it.</p>
               <p>The backwardneſs of the then Government from examining into this Matter, and their unjuſt Proceedings againſt the Proſecution, (for they Diſcouraged, Proſecuted, and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined him who did humbly offer the Matter to a Judicial Conſideration, though no Crime or Colour of Offence was proved againſt him) is farther Evidence of this Murther.</p>
               <p>The Government turned the Old <hi>Edwards</hi> out of his place, for what his Son ſaid in this Matter, and hereby inverted the old Proverb, <hi>For here the Son's eating Sower Grapes, had ſet the Father's Teeth on edge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A poor Soldier was barbarouſly Whipt (after he had been cruelly managed in Priſon) for only ſaying, That <hi>he would not ſay, he did believe the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>cut his own Throat:</hi> But a more barbarous Cruelty is juſtly ſuſpected to have been committed, in the <hi>After-murther</hi> of ſeveral (<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Meake</hi> and <hi>Hawley, &amp;c.</hi>) to prevent a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of this.</p>
               <p>Though the Government heretofore had received private Intimations, and in Print publick Applications for a Pardon, and thereupon a Promiſe of a full Diſcovery; and in both theſe the Duke of <hi>York</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly charged, as the chief Contriver of this Horrid Cruelty, yet the then Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would never permit ſuch an Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be made, but puniſhed thoſe that diſperſed thoſe publick Challenges. Had His Highneſs been really Innocent, none would have been more Zealous for ſuch a Proclamation of Pardon, <hi>For Innocence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires a Tryal, and it's only Guilt that flies from Juſtice.</hi> Another Argument of this Murder, and likewiſe of Major <hi>Webſter</hi>'s Guilt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is <hi>Webſter</hi>'s producing my Lord's Pocket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handkerchief all Bloody to ſome of his Neighbours, rejoycing at the Blood of a Traytor; and the very next day, to ſome of the ſame Perſons, he produced part of the Price of Blood, <hi>viz.</hi> a Purſe of Gold, wherein there was 49 Guinea's and a Piſtole, which he ſhewed in great Oſtentation; but all this was but a ſmall part of that Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous Reward; for ſome time after my Lord's Death, when his Wife was upbraided with her Husband's Poverty, ſhe replied, <hi>Her Husband long ſince was not ſo poor, for he had</hi> 500 <hi>Guinea's;</hi> at which the other being ſtartled, anſwered, <hi>moſt certainly he could not come by them Honeſtly:</hi> To which it was ſaid, <hi>That he got them by his Trade:</hi> But to that it was replied, That <hi>his Trade could hardly get Bread:</hi> Therefore there muſt be ſome other way.</p>

               <p>That his Wife was not a Stranger to his Guilt, appears by her often telling him (upon her hard uſage) That <hi>he was a Fool
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41825:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>as well as a Rogue, to uſe her ſo very ill, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in whoſe power he well knew it was, to Hang both him and another in the Tower.</hi> Another Inſtance of this kind there happened, when <hi>Homes</hi> and his Wife (ſome time after my Lord's Death) quarrelled; <hi>Homes</hi> abuſing her, ſhe told him, <hi>He was a murderous Rogue, and he muſt well know that ſhe could at any time hang him for it.</hi> To which <hi>Homes</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered [with his uſual Scurrilous Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) <hi>You Bitch, you Whore, you of all the World have no reaſon to ſpeak, for do not you remember I bought you a good Sattin Gown and Petticoat:</hi> Whereupon the Wife replied, <hi>You are a murdering Rogue for all that.</hi>
